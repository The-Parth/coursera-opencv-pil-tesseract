Rick Snyder\nwon reelection Tuesday, defeat-\ning Democratic challenger Mark\nSchauer ina closer-than-expect-\ned campaign.\n\nWith most precincts in the\nstate reporting, Snyder captured\n51 percent of the vote compared\nto Schauer\u2019s 47 percent. In the\nlast few days before the election,\nSnyder and Schauer were close\nin the polls with the Detroit Free\nPress reporting a two-point lead\nin Snyder\u2019s favor on Oct. 29.\n\nIn his victory speech at the\nRenaissance Center in Detroit\nTuesday night, Snyder empha-\nsized the economic trouble the\nstate had long endured and his\nefforts to fundamentally change\nits course.\n\n\u201cOur spirit was being broken,\u201d\n\nSnyder said. \u201cIt was not the time\nto fix Michigan; that was not\ngoing to be good enough. It was\ntime to reinvent Michigan.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Snyder said\nthere was plenty of evidence of\nan economic turnaround. He\npointed to the creation of nearly\n300,000 private sector jobs, the\nincrease in the value of Michi-\ngan homes and the greater num-\nber of college graduates taking\njobs in the state as indicators of\nsuccess.\n\nYet despite Snyder\u2019s belief\nin the success of his first term,\nhe maintained there was much\nwork to be done in the next four\nyears.\n\n\u201cWhen you have success like\nthis what\u2019s the next thing you\nneed to do? It\u2019s not to stay com-\nplacent, it\u2019s time to accelerate\nand go even faster,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nSnyder hinted at some of\nhis goals for his second term,\nlike filling tens of thousands of\nskilled trade jobs, helping young\npeople connect with education\nopportunities and improving\naccess to career technical edu-\ncation, all of which he hopes will\nlead to more well-paying middle\nclass jobs.\n\nFour years after running on\n\na pledge to reinvent Michigan\u2019s\neconomy, Snyder was able to\nsecure a second term largely\non his fulfillment of that prom-\nise. His supporters point to his\nhands-on approach to Detroit\u2019s\nrecovery as a signature accom-\nplishment of his first term. The\nstate legislature, the city and its\ncreditors and pensioners struck\na Grand Bargain that allowed\nthe city to move ahead with its\nbankruptcy proceedings, which\nwill wrap up this month.\n\nOn higher education, Snyder\ncut state funding in 2011 with\nthe promise to raise it again in\nsubsequent years. He has incre-\nmentally increased the funding\nbut has yet to return it to the 2011\nlevels. Consequently, Schauer\nattempted to brand himself as\nthe \u201ceducation governor\u201d in his\ncampaign, calling for its funding\nto be restored to pre-2011 levels\nupon election to office.\n\nIn terms of the statewide\neconomy, Snyder repealed the\nMichigan Business Tax and\nreplaced it with a flat tax to\nappeal to new businesses, and\neach of his last two budgets\nhave resulted in a surplus. Addi-\ntionally, the state\u2019s 7.2-percent\n\nSee SNYDER, Page 4A\n\nIn dark day\n\nDemocratic U.S.\nSenate candidate\nbucks national\ntrend\n\nBy SHOHAM GEVA\nDaily Staff Reporter\n\nU.S. House Rep. Gary Peters\n(D-Detroit) will be the next\nU.S Senator from Michigan.\n\nPeters, who has served in the\nU.S House of Representatives\nfor five years, faced off against\nTerri Lynn Land, former\nMichigan Secretary of State.\nThe race was called by CNN\nand the Detroit Free Press at 9\np.m, and as of press time early\nWednesday morning with 95\npercent of precincts reporting,\nPeters led Land 55 percent to\n41 percent.\n\nMinutes after Peters\u2019 pro-\njected win was announced,\nLand called Peters to concede.\nShe did not release a statement,\ntalk to the press or speak to\nthe Republican watch party in\n\nDetroit following her conces-\nsion.\n\nPeters will succeed fellow\nDemocrat Carl Levin, who has\nserved in the U.S. Senate for\nmore than 35 years. The seat\nwas originally expected to be\nhotly contested and potentially\na key race to determine which\nparty would be the overall\nmajority in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Peters, who main-\ntained a slight lead in the polls\nover Land throughout much\nof the general election season,\npulled away from his opponent\nsignificantly by the last quar-\nter of the race to a double-digit\nlead.\n\n\u201cMichigan was obviously a\nsquandered opportunity for\nthe Republicans,\u201d Political\nScience Prof. Michael Trau-\ngott said Tuesday night. \u201cHer\ncampaign got off to a bad start\nbecause of the initial interac-\ntion with the media, so her\ncampaign team decided to\nhide her from reporters and\nrestricted her access to voters\nat public events, so she never\n\nSee PETERS, Page 4A\n\nWEATHER GOT A NEWS TIP?

In the 12th U.S. House\nDistrict, the Detroit Free Press\nhas called the race for Debbie\nDingell, wife of current U.S.\nHouse Rep. John Dingell (D).\n\nShe is the third Dingell to hold\na Michigan Congressional seat,\nfollowing current Rep. John\nDingell and his father, John\nDingell, Sr.\n\nIn avictory speech at the state\nDemocrat watch party Tuesday\nnight in Detroit, Dingell thanked\nher staff, family and campaign,\nand said there were two people\nshe wanted to thank specifically\nby name: her husband, outgoing\n\nRep. Dingell, and outgoing U.S\nSenator Carl Levin.\n\n\u201cThese Democrats, two giants\nof men...have served this state\na very very long time,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd what we have to remember\nis that they\u2019ve been the voice of\nMichigan\u2019s values, of respecting\nworking men and women and\nstanding firm for what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nDingell faced off against\nRepublican candidate Terry\nBowman, a Ford employee and\nkey player in the 2012 right-\nto-work battle in the state. She\nmade higher education, namely\nreducing student debt, a key\nfocus, hosting higher educa-\ntion roundtables at universities\nacross the state to discuss issues\nfacing students and universities.\n\nDingell, who serves as a trust-\nee at Wayne State University\nrecently voted against a tuition\nincrease at that institution.\n\n\u201cT\u2019ve been on the Wayne State\nboard for eight years,\u201d Dingell\nsaid in a June interview with\n\nThe Michigan Daily. \u201cEvery sin-\ngle year, it seems like it\u2019s becom-\ning more challenging and more\ndifficult and harder to afford\na higher education. And every\nsingle day, I am meeting young\npeople who are graduating with\n\nstaggering debt.\u201d\nA founder of the National\nWomen\u2019s\u2019 Health Resource\n\nCenter, Dingell also champi-\noned affordable health care and\ninvesting in health research that\nincludes women, and advocated\nfor policies that extend rights to\nsame-sex couples.\n\n\u201cIf two people love each other,\nwhy should we keep them from\nbeing with each other?\u201d Ding-\nell said in an October interview\nwith The Michigan Daily.\n\nIn her victory speech Tues-\nday night, Dingell touched on all\nthose areas, also emphasizing\njob creation in the state.\n\n\u201cWe're going to keep fighting\nahead for the values we all care\nabout- to protect manufactur-\ning, that if you are sick you don\u2019t\nworry about whether you need\nto go to a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\nthat our children, 25 percent of\nour population and 100 percent\nof our future, they deserve qual-\nity, affordable education. That\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m fighting for. That\u2019s\nwhat I stand here for tonight.\u201d\n\nIn a October interview with\nthe Daily, she said the 2008\nfinancial crash heavily impacted\nthe job market, which, unlike\nthe auto industry, has not recov-\nered. Dingell has highlighted the\nimportance of job creation espe-\ncially for young college gradu-\nates and those forced into early\nretirement.\n\nIn an October interview with\nThe Michigan Daily, Bowman\nemphasized his distance from\nWashington as one benefit of\nhim taking the congressional\nseat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fault of the individual,\nbut I think that if you\u2019re in Con-\ngress for a long time you com-\npletely lose the ability to connect\nwith what goes on each and\nevery day,\u201d he said.\n\nIncumbents keep seats\nin midterm elections\n\nRepublicans\nmaintain hold in\nexecutive office\n\nBy GOVERNMENT BEAT\n\nMichigan Republicans held\ntheir posts statewide, winning\nthe Attorney General and Sec-\nretary of State races and push-\ning Governor Rick Snyder to\nreelection. Meanwhile, Ann\nArbor district-level Democrat-\nic politicians maintained their\nhold on the U.S. House of Rep-\nresentatives, Michigan House\nof Representatives and Michi-\ngan State Senate.\n\nAttorney General\n\nMichigan Attorney General\nBill Schuette (R) will retain his\nseat, besting Democrat Mark\nTotten. As of 2 a.m. Wednesday\nmorning, unofficial election\nresults showed that Schuette\nled Totten 52.1 percent to 44.2\npercent.\n\n\u201cI will continue to serve as\na voice for the constitution,\nbecause there are cops and\nfirefighters who worked hard\nin a tough city whose pensions\nwere at risk,\u201d Schuette said ina\nspeech at the Renaissance Cen-\nter Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI am an optimist at the core,\nand this election is all about\ntomorrows,\u201d Schuette said. \u201cI\nam confident Michigan\u2019s best\ntomorrows are just ahead. \u201c\n\nSchuette, who outspent Tot-\nten by a near six-to-one margin\nduring the campaign, has said\nhe would like to be a \u201cvoice for\nvictims\u201d of all crimes in his\nsecond term.\n\nFormerly a_ federal pros-\necutor, Totten emphasized his\ndesire to protect Michigan citi-\nzens from economic crime. He\nalso aimed to better support\nwomen\u2019s and students\u2019 rights,\ntwo areas in which he said\nSchuette failed.\n\nIn his first term, Schuette\n\nhas attempted to protect the\nstate\u2019s ban on same-sex mar-\nriage and its ban on affirmative\naction.\n\nSecretary of State\n\nSecretary of State Ruth\nJohnson (R) kept her seat\nagainst Democratic challeng-\ner Godfrey Dillard. Unoffi-\ncial election results indicated\nJohnson led Dillard 53.5 per-\ncent to 42.9 percent at 2 a.m.\n\nJohnson\u2019s reelection cam-\npaign emphasized her work in\ncustomer service and expand-\ning the department\u2019s online ser-\nvices. She previously worked as\nthe clerk and register for deeds\nin Oakland County.\n\nDillard, a Detroit attorney,\nannounced his campaign in\nAugust. Following his defeat,\nhe said his campaign stint was\nstill impactful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not discouraged,\u201d Dil-\nlard said. \u201cI think as I go for-\nward Ill keep looking for ways\nI can serve the citizens of\nMichigan.\u201d\n\nMichigan State Senate\n\nState Sen. Rebekah Warren\n(D-Ann Arbor) won her second\nterm over Republican challeng-\ner Terry Linden.\n\nWarren has served Ann\nArbor as a state senator since\n2011. Previously, Warren\nserved in the Michigan House\nof Representatives from 2007\nto 2010.\n\nIn her tenure, Warren has\nfocused on women\u2019s rights and\nenvironmental protection. In\nSeptember, she co-introduced\nlegislation to require all health\ninsurance companies to pro-\nvide the option to purchase\nabortion service coverage. She\nhas also sponsored legislation\nto help sexual assault survi-\nvors, gender pay equity and\nworks to extend workplace\nfamily medical leave.\n\nWarren is invested in\nimproving the environment. In\n\nMay, she demanded with other\npoliticians to cease oil and gas\ndrilling in nearby Scio Town-\nship.\n\nWarren has also fought to\nimprove state support for both\nK-12 and higher education.\n\nLinden, her challenger, was\nnot available to media during\nthe campaign.\n\nMichigan House\nof Representatives\n\nState representative Jeff\nIrwin (D-Ann Arbor) has won\nreelection for a third term,\ndefeating Republican challeng-\ner John Spisak.\n\nIrwin has pushed for greater\nstate involvement in all levels\nof education and has argued\nthat improving the state\u2019s edu-\ncational institutions can be a\nmeans of economic growth. In\nApril 2013, Irwin proposed a\nbill to extend in-state tuition\nequality to undocumented\nstudents, a move hailed by on-\ncampus student groups.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good state pol-\nicy to try to keep those people\nhere in Michigan, giving them\nopportunity to contribute to\nour economy and communi-\nties,\u201d Irwin said in a 2013 inter-\nview with the Daily.\n\nHe has also been an advo-\ncate for improved environ-\nmental protections, and\nsupports increased investment\nin infrastructure to aid eco-\nnomic recovery.\n\nSpisak, an Ann Arbor resi-\ndent, is a stay-at-home father\nwho previously owned small\nbusinesses. He prioritized\ninvesting in roads, bridges and\nother infrastructure. He also\ncampaigned to better educa-\ntion.\n\nDaily News Editor Rachel\nPremack and Daily Staff Report-\ners Ben Atlas, Shoham Geva and\nGenevieve Hummer contributed\nto this report.\n",

Last Fri-\n\nDave Brandon\u2019s_resigna- vam -\\\ntion. He also appointed feo = |\nformer Steelcase CEO Jim =>\n\nHackett as the interim\nAthletic Director \u2014 key\n\nword interim.\n\nThat got me thinking and\nactually pretty excited. As\nof right now, I don\u2019t have\nany plans for next summer\nand should probably start working on intern-\nship and job applications sometime soon. The\nsearch process for the next athletic director\nhasn\u2019t begun yet either and anything you see\nor hear on the news is just hearsay at this\npoint. So before this opportunity slips away\nfrom me, I am officially announcing myself as\na candidate for the Athletic Director position\nat the University of Michigan.\n\nBefore I get written off as unqualified, let\nme explain. Mr. Hackett, feel free to use this\nas acover letter if it suits you.\n\nAt the press conference, Schlissel said the\nnew athletic director must be \u201ca person of\nunquestioned integrity, not just integrity to\nthe level of NCAA rules.\u201d\n\nFor starters, I\u2019ve never allegedly e-mailed\nan alumnus passive-aggressively telling them\nto \u201chave a happy life\u201d or \u201cstop drinking and go\nto bed.\u201d\n\nSecond, one of my professors referred to\nme as a \u201cgreat guy\u201d in office hours. If those\ntwo examples don\u2019t represent \u201cunquestioned\nintegrity,\u201d I\u2019m not sure what does. However,\nfor those still unconvinced about my qualifi-\ncations, please read on.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about my leadership\nskills, there\u2019s nothing to fear. Six people\nhave endorsed me on LinkedIn for \u201cleader-\nship,\u201d and admittedly, I\u2019m pretty proud of\nthat. Small sample size, yes. But I know those\npeople didn\u2019t hesitate for a second when\nthey hit the endorse button. That counts for\nsomething.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for someone who knows a\nthing or two about generating sales and build-\ning a brand, look no further. I have more than\n530 followers on Twitter \u2014 although most of\nthem think I play for the Denver Broncos. In\nthe business, we call that a dedicated follow-\ning. In my younger days, I ran some pretty\nsuccessful lemonade stands. And I never once\nconsidered raising the price to maximize rev-\nenue because I didn\u2019t want the community\n\nDEREK\nWOLFE\n\nROBERT SCHWARZHAUPT |\n\nto lose faith in me. A 25-cent glass, now and\nforever. To top it off, I\u2019ve never sold terrible\npizza. I think that wins a few H.A.I.L. points.\n\nSchlissel also mentioned that the next\nathletic director doesn\u2019t have to have\nMichigan ties. He reiterated this point in an\ninterview with the Daily on Monday, \u201cI\u2019m\nalways open to the idea that someone from\nthe outside might help us be even better. I just\nwant to get the best person.\u201d\n\nClearly, this is where I\u2019m at a little bit of\na disadvantage. I am a \u201cMichigan Man\u201d\nafter all \u2014 if having a University e-mail\naccount makes you one. However, I contend\nI would bring a nice balance to the Athletic\nDepartment.\n\nFirst off, I never played for legendary\nfootball coach Bo Schembechler. In fact, I\nnever played football. That being said, I\u2019ve still\nsucceeded in athletics. Though you might not\nbe able tell by looking at me, I was an integral\nmember of a championship basketball team\non my hometown\u2019s local recreational league\n\u2014 there were only seven players and my dad\nwas the coach. For this, I am, and will always\nbe, a winner. Sure, the last guy may have had\nthree Big Ten championship rings, but \u2019m\nalso confident I got more playing time than\nhe did.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve never worked in an athletic\ndepartment before, I\u2019ve been to my fair\nshare of football and basketball games. That\nshould suffice. I\u2019m also proficient in addition\nand subtraction so the budget stuff is no\nbig deal. Also, in case you forgot, I\u2019ve run a\nlemonade stand before. Can you say business\nexperience?\n\nI would bring a solid understanding of the\nstudent voice. Heck, when I want student\ninput on an issue all \u2019ll have to do is think.\nNo other candidate will be able to say that.\n\nWith that, I feel I\u2019ve covered all the bases.\nI might be the \u201cunorthodox\u201d candidate, but\nthat\u2019s what the University needs right now:\nSomeone who\u2019s not afraid to tell it how it is\nand enact necessary change. Someone with\nvision and relevant experience.\n\nLastFriday, whenasked about what qualities\nhe envisioned in the future athletic director,\nSchlissel responded, \u201cI have excellence\nin mind.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, and considering how the\nprevious Athletic Director performed, then I\nmust be the man for the job. Some might even\nsay I\u2019m overqualified. Just don\u2019t forget I can\u2019t\nstart until the summer.\n\nAcademics come first.\n\n\u2014 Derek Wolfe can be reached\nat dewolfe@umich.edu.\n\nInclusive language, only part of the solution\n\nIthink we need to have a talk about inclusive\nlanguage and its relation to social justice here\nat the University. With the new inclusive\nlanguage campaign kicking off, it\u2019s time we\nmake sure to keep things in perspective. First\nof all, I want to recognize my place of privilege\nin this area. I am a white presenting, middle\nclass, cisgender male who largely does not face\nthe mounting burden of micro-aggressions.\nAs always, it is important to keep that in mind\nas I only face micro-aggressions for my queer\nidentity, which does play a role in how I view\nthis topic. However, I\u2019d like to move forward\nas a student of social science, which will\ninform my thoughts.\n\nThe more social justice circles that I\u2019ve nav-\nigated through, the more I have come across\na fixation on making sure language is inclu-\nsive. People actively make an effort to correct\neach other in order to make sure their diction\nis properly inclusive. And while this prac-\ntice is valuable, and certainly necessary, I am\nbeginning to worry. Yes, language has a pow-\nerful effect in perpetuating unfair and unjust\nsystems, dynamics and institutions. Yes, lan-\nguage can be powerfully racist, sexist, bigoted\nand unintentionally hateful. Yes, language is\na subtle and subversive form of problematic\nconditioning. And yes, understanding and cor-\nrecting problematic language is one step in\ncreating an equitably functional society. How-\never, this newly growing modern view of strict\ninclusive language is proving more and more\ndangerous. Simply put, this massive amount\nof energy focused on only inclusive language\nin social justice spaces convinces people social\njustice issues can be fixed simply by applying\nstrict scrutiny to our words. Monitoring lan-\nguage to be more inclusive, while comforting,\nactually does very little to help fix the larger\noppressive macro-systems and institutions\nthat plague America and fuel injustice. Rath-\ner, inclusive language can be used to create a\nspace where interpersonal dialogue may lead\nto generating potential solutions to larger\n\nsocial problems. Inclusive language is simply\none method to facilitate the creation of spaces\nwhere diversity is at the center of the dialogue.\nHowever, in and of itself, inclusive language\ndoes very little to solve the larger problems\nthat fuel injustice in society on a mass scale.\n\nBefore I go on, I would like to be clear that\nmaking people comfortable in social settings\nis very important. However, let\u2019s not conflate\nthis with fixing systemic injustice. This\nmodern fixation on strict scrutiny of language,\nwhile well-intentioned, takes the focus away\nfrom realities of fixing our larger society and\nthe complex tasks associated with it. Fixing\nsocial justice issues will require complex\nadvocacy, coalition-building, research and\na real understanding of social dynamics,\npsychology and politics. It is unfortunate\nthat policing language is where social justice\nstarts and ends from many people, because\nit does nothing to help the real, pressing\nneeds. The modern practice of language\npolicing to be \u201cinclusive\u201d fails to recognize\nthe social politics of interpersonal education,\nmotivating political support and coalition-\nbuilding. Simply put, it turns many people\naway from social justice issues in a way that\ndoes nothing to build support or solve them.\n\nAgain, let me be clear in saying that\npeople should be held accountable to their\nwords. Language has a real effect on social\ninteractions, and everyone should strive to\nunderstand how their language can make\npeople feel, but we should be wary on its actual\nefficacy in solving the problems that have\nhuge effects on people\u2019s lives such as cyclical\npoverty and the achievement gap.\n\nUltimately, policing language is a subtle form\nof slacktivism and does very little in creating\nactual change in the way marginalized groups\nare institutionally oppressed.\n\nRobert Schwarzhaupt is an LSA senior\nand a Programming Board Member in\nthe Trotter Multicultural Center.\n\nWhen I abandoned beauty for strength\n\nwrong reasons.\nI heard it\nlook\n\nI started weightlifting for all the\n\nwill give me\n\nthe toned\nof Gisele.\n\nI heard it will\ngive me the ass\nof J. Lo.\n\nI heard it\nwill give me\nthe arms of\nJennifer Aniston.\n\nI heard it\nwill give me the\nslender legs of\nHeidi Klum.\n\nT heard it will give me the flat abs\nof Rihanna.\n\nI heard it will give me a body\nother than my own.\n\nA year ago, I listened to the\nmagazines, movies, celebrities,\nfriends and family that told me\nexercise could move my body far\naway from its current form. I pored\nover the advice and tips that detailed\nhow to lift small weights to achieve\nthe beauty ideal of the perfect\nfemale celebrity. They all directed\nme toward the same end goal \u2014 thin\nand toned. Alone with these voices,\nI had become fogged by the pursuit\nof changing my body beyond its\nnormal form.\n\nCreating my exercise plan started\nwith opening the expanding pull-\nouts from the middle of women\u2019s\nmagazines. Each pull-out displayed\na sequence of exercises done by\nwispy white women. They had no\nsweat, no creases, no fat and were\nholding only two-pound weights.\nA TV remote could have replaced\nthe weights they happily clutched.\nNowhere had I seen images\nof women lifting weights that\n\ndemanded real strength.\n\nThough I consumed these images\nwholeheartedly, they sent me dan-\ngerous messages. They informed me\nthat lifting weights should be done,\nironically, to not gain visible mus-\ncles. They told me that I should not\nbe \u201cbulky\u201d or \u201cbig\u201d or \u201cmuscular.\u201d\nThey led me to believe that I should\nwant the opposite. I should not want\nto inhabit three-dimensional space.\nI should want to be thin and lean\nenough, so I appeared defenseless.\n\nBesides the visible messages that\nthe fitness media was imparting, I\nfound underlying lessons between\nthe aspiration of thigh gaps. They\ntold me that by consuming less\nspace, I would receive more love and\nworth. The areas my body left blank\ncould be filled with more points on\nan attractiveness scale designed by\nmen. As I peered into the images\nof perfectly toned women in\nfitness magazines, I saw their eyes\nhinting to me that a woman\u2019s body\nshould never reveal real power nor\nintimidate men. It was hard to look\naway. Their stare was gripping, and\nsoon I came to see what they saw.\n\nEach day, I followed the sequenc-\nes that were supposed to burn more\ncalories than cardio. I religiously\ndid very little weight at high rep-\netition in order to build leanness\ninstead of big muscles. The fear of\nbecoming unattractive sustained\nmy resistance of looking strong.\nSoon weightlifting became some-\nthing I did for others \u2014 to allow oth-\ners to find me attractive and worthy.\n\nAfter months of revisiting the\nsame routines and the same corners\nof the gym, I still was very removed\nfrom the body I was promised. And\nI was exhausted. I was exhausted by\n\nthe need to constantly adhere to one\nideal and to exercise feebly. I decid-\ned to listen to my exhaustion and to\nabandon what I was supposed to do.\nAs I wished to switch to new rou-\ntines, I found very little knowledge\non how a woman can become strong\ninstead of beautiful.\n\nMy journey to find new ways\nof lifting weights led me to see\nthe obvious.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that so many\nwomen of all ages wish to adhere to\na singular beauty ideal. And it\u2019s no\nwonder most women believe they\nwill become massive bodybuilders if\nthey begin to lift weights. And it\u2019s no\nwonder that the image of a woman\nbodybuilder is unattractive, because\nof its \u201cthreatening\u201d demeanor to\nmen. And it\u2019s no wonder that there\nis little knowledge circulating\nwomen\u2019s minds on how to safely\nand properly lift weights. And it\u2019s\nno wonder that the free weight\nsection of every gym lacks women\nwhile men are overpopulating\n\nit. And it\u2019s no wonder I was\nafraid to ignore norms _ by\nbecoming strong.\n\nAnd it\u2019s no wonder when a\nwoman\u2019s worth is labeled by her\nneed for the strength of men.\n\nAfter learning the hidden\nobviousness, I let my strength truly\nreveal itself. I let my body move\ntoward the gravitational pull it\ndesired. I longed to be strong for\nmyself and honored my body as it\nmorphed into unforeseen molds.\nThrough my journey, I have come to\nappreciate my ability to grow to its\nown tune.\n\n\u2014 Maja Tosic can be reached\nat tosimaj@umich.edu.\n\nEDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS\n\nDevin Eggert, David Harris, Rachel John, Jordyn Kay, Aarica\nMarsh, Megan McDonald, Victoria Noble, Allison Raeck,\nMelissa Scholke, Michael Schramm, Matthew Seligman,\n\nMary Kate Winn, Jenny Wang, Daniel Wang, Derek Wolfe\n\nJAIKOB DJERF AND DANIEL MADION |\n\nA culturally transmitted disease?\n\nOn July 11, the World Health\nOrganization announced its\nrecommendation for all men who\nhave sex with men (MSM) to begin\ntaking antiretroviral drugs as a\nprecaution to combat the spread of\nHIV/AIDS worldwide. This came\nas a shock to many Americans who\nin recent years haven\u2019t read or\nheard many news stories about the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nSince the initial HIV/AIDS\nepidemic started in the 1980s, rates\nof HIV transmission in the United\nStates have generally remained\nstable. According to the Centers for\nDisease Control, it\u2019s estimated that\n1.1 million Americans are living\nwith HIV, and that one out of six\ndon\u2019t know that they have HIV.\n\nThe group in the United States\nthat remains most affected by HIV/\nAIDS is MSM. HIV infection in\nthe United States has declined in\nevery group except gay/bisexual\nmen. Rates of HIV infection have\nactually been increasing among\nthis group. From 2008 to 2010,\nthe rate of new HIV infections for\nMSM climbed 12 percent. In 2010,\nMSM made up approximately 4\npercent of the U.S. population, but\naccounted for 63 percent of all new\nHIV infections.\n\nIn 2010, women accounted for 20\npercent of all new HIV infections,\nand 84 percent of these were\nattributed to heterosexual contact.\nIn that same year, \u201cwhite MSM\ncontinued to account for the largest\nnumber of new HIV infections,\u201d\naccording to the CDC.\n\nTherearetwostigmasat playhere:\nthe assumption in the heterosexual\npopulation that HIV/AIDS is a gay\n\ndisease, and the assumption in the\nwhite MSM population that HIV/\nAIDS is a disease associated with\nminority MSM. The mainstream\nmedia today portrays HIV/AIDS\nin the gay community or in IV\ndrug users. People assume that as\nlong as they aren\u2019t having sex with\npeople from these communities\nthat their risk for HIV isn\u2019t very\nhigh. These stigmas, along with the\nlack of a legitimate sex education,\nthen lead to unsafe sex and not\nbeing regularly tested for sexually\ntransmitted infections. In order to\nstop this unsafe trend, the myths\n\nsurrounding HIV/AIDS must\nbe dispelled.\nOne-fourth of new HIV\n\ninfections occur in youth ages 13\nto 24; most of those infected are\nunknowing, not getting tested/\ntreated and potentially infecting\nmore people. HIV after contraction\nmay or may not produce symptoms.\nWithin two to four weeks after the\ninitial exposure, people may feel\nflu-like symptoms, but eventually\nthese symptoms subside.\n\nMany people will live years\nbefore being diagnosed with HIV\nor AIDS. In a campus survey our\nProgram on Intergroup Relations\nclass group conducted, only 20\npercent of respondents have been\ntested for STIs in the last three\nmonths, and of that 20 percent only\n11 percent were also tested for HIV.\nCommon responses for not being\ntested were that no symptoms are\npresent, or that respondents did\nnot think that they were at risk.\nAnother common response was the\nstigma that goes along with being\ntested for HIV. Respondents didn\u2019t\n\nwant their doctors to think they\nwere gay or having risky sex. This\nis especially true for bisexual men\nwho, because of society, choose not\nto get tested and not to tell partners\nabout their encounters with men.\nThe misconceptions around campus\nabout HIV/AIDS are apparent.\n\nHIV/AIDS affects people indis-\ncriminately, and although the only\nsure way to avoid contracting HIV\nis through abstinence, there are\nmany ways to greatly reduce your\nrisk. These include using latex or\npolyurethane \u2014condoms/barriers,\nusing water-based lubricant, ask-\ning your partner about their sexual\nhistory, avoiding alcohol or drugs as\nthey alter the decision-making and\nchoosing lower-risk sexual activi-\nties. Frequent STI screenings (that\ninclude HIV) are also essential.\nAlthough HIV/AIDS is most promi-\nnent today in the MSM and African\nAmerican community, all sexually\nactive people are at risk. Especially\nwhen involved with casual sex part-\nners who may not have been tested\nthemselves, or may have lied about\ntheir sexual histories. Sleeping with\nsomeone is like sleeping with every-\none that they\u2019ve ever slept with too.\n\nTransmission of HIV is fully\npreventable; most of the new cases\ncontracted are due to a lack of\nknowledge and lack of precaution.\nThere are many great resources in\nAnn Arbor for both STI testing and\nsafe sex. For more information about\nSTI testing and HIV/AIDS statistics,\nplease visit the CDC website or the\nUHS website.\n\nJaikob Djerf is an LSA sophomore\nand Daniel Madion is an LSA freshman.\n\nI am proud to say that after 23 or (24) years on the\nradio we have learned absolutely nothing.

Following\nthe announcement of his can-\ndidacy in July, Kelly did little\ncampaigning and focused on\ndeveloping his position on the\nissues themselves through his\nwebsite and various mayoral\ndebates.\n\nTaylor said while his victory\nwas not a surprise, Kelly took\ninitiative and showed a passion\nfor local politics.\n\n\u201cT think that it is a democra-\ncy and people who want to run\ncan and chose to run, and he did\nmake that decision and I hope\nthat it was an experience that\nmet his expectations,\u201d Taylor\nsaid.\n\nTaylor is currently in his\nthird term as a city coun-\ncilmember representing Ward\n3. As the first new mayor in 14\nyears, Taylor has positioned\nhimself to follow in current\nAnn Arbor Mayor John Hieft-\nje\u2019s footsteps. His approach\nto key issues in this election,\nwhich\nUniversity and city relations\n\ninclude development,\nand addressing infrastructure\nneeds, echo that of Hieftje\u2019s.\n\nFor Kelly, he said the race\nwas a good experience, generat-\ning thoughtful debate about the\nissues in Ann Arbor while keep-\ning a lighthearted atmosphere.\nOn top of that, Kelly said he was\nhappy to see his work didn\u2019t go\nunnoticed.\n\n\u201cI did not know what to\nexpect and it feels really good\nwhen you\u2019re an independent\nto see 5,000 people vote for\nyou because that means 5,000\npeople took the time to bubble\nin your name,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI\nfeel like even as a newcomer to\npolitics, this is a very welcome\ndevelopment. Chris obviously\nreceived a lot more, and that\nmakes sense, but I\u2019m thrilled\n\n\u201cIT take the job of being a\nrepresentative very seriously,\nwhich means being in the com-\nmunity, being accessible, lis-\ntening to folks, and I think that\npaid off today,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nthey were looking for someone\nwho is out there working to\nearn the right to represent the\npeople of Michigan in Wash-\nington D.C.\u201d\n\nwith this.\u201d\n\nKelly added that he is still\ninterested in city government.\n\n\u201c\u2019'm going to keep an eye\non how the city council Ward\n1 race and see if I agree with\nthe people who are running for\nthat,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Kelly, he said the race\nwas a good experience, gener-\nating thoughtful debate about\nthe issues in Ann Arbor while\nkeeping a lighthearted atmo-\nsphere.

Taylor said he\nexpects to meet with Univer-\nsity President Mark Schlissel\nnext week to discuss issues sur-\nrounding the University\u2019s rela-\ntionship with the city.\n\nFurthermore, Taylor rec-\nognized infrastructure to be\none of the key issues following\nlast winter\u2019s harsh conditions.\nHe said this is in many ways\n\nPeters found success running\non a platform focused on his\nrecord on the economy, climate\nchange and women\u2019s issues.\nEarly in the general election\ncampaign season, he hosted a\n\u201cGreat Lakes Job Tour,\u201d high-\nlighting the role that the state\u2019s\nbusinesses played in support-\ning the Great Lakes and vice\nversa.

Despite\nsecured an agreement with\nCanadian officials to go for-\nward with the New Interna-\ntional Trade Crossing, a new\nbridge connecting Detroit and\nWindsor.\n\nfor their families, they want\nto be able to send their kids to\ngood schools and live in safe\n\nan absentee ballot in person.\nKestenbaum said this law was a\nhindrance to students who lived\naway from their home districts,\nand politicians believed that it\nwas futile to attempt to market\nto young voters.\n\nAt Pierpont Commons, Ann\nArbor resident Lisa Jibson, a\npoll volunteer, said many stu-\ndents tried to vote Tuesday who\ncould not. They were registered\nin a district outside of Ann\nArbor or had moved from their\noriginal registration address\nwithin the city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to redirect quite\na few,\u201d Jibson said. \u201cWe hate to\nhave anyone feel like they didn\u2019t\nget the chance to vote.\u201d\n\nLSA freshman Cole Zingas\nvoted for the first time Tuesday\nmorning. Zingas said he wanted\nto vote regardless of party lines,\nand voted for mostly Democrats\nsave Republican Gov. Rick Sny-\nder.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t believe Mark\nSchauer had any kind of real\nplan for the state,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nliked what Rick Snyder did the\nlast few years in Michigan.\u201d\n\nKestenbaum said he antici-\npated larger-than-average par-\nticipation in Washtenaw County\nin this midterm election, to the\ntune of 140,000 voters. The 2010\nmidterm election saw just over\n\nThe Medicaid and bridge\ndecisions were indicative of\nSnyder\u2019s willingness to break\nwith his party, and followed\nthe principles laid out in his\nfirst campaign. A former chief\nexecutive of computer com-\npany Gateway and a venture\ncapitalist, Snyder entered\nthe 2010 gubernatorial race\nas a relative unknown and a\npolitical novice. His pledge to\nput politics aside and instead\nuse his business acumen to\nimprove the state appealed\nto voters, as he sailed to an\n18-point victory over Demo-\ncrat Virg Bernero.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to drop the labels\n... of party, of ideology, of geog-\nraphy,\u201d Snyder said in his 2010\nvictory speech. \u201cTo make this\nwork there is only one label\n\nthat matters. That label is\n\nwant to have quality health care\n\ninently\n\n120,000 turn out to cast a ballot,\nwhile more than 180,000 voted\nin Washtenaw County during\nthe 2012 election.\n\nEarly exit polls from the\nNational Exit Poll data by Edi-\nson Research for this year\u2019s\nmidterm election report that\nthe youth electorate was at 13\npercent, slightly higher than in\n2010, though the statistic is sub-\nject to change within the next\nfew days.\n\nLon Johnson, chair of the\nMichigan Democratic Party,\nsaid voter turnout was a possi-\nble hurdle in the election, yet\nexpressed optimism in the par-\nty\u2019s attempt to get eligible voters\nto the ballots.\n\nPoll\na boost in ballots over 2010.\n\nvolunteers reported\nJibson said turnout was good\nconsidering it was a midterm\nelection.\n\nCollege Republicans, College\nDemocrats and the Public Poli-\ncy School held separate watch\nparties for Tuesday night\u2019s elec-\ntion results.\n\nFour students attended the\nCollege Republicans\u2019 watch\nparty, including LSA senior\nSarah Cunningham. She said\nyounger and older members of\nthe party differ on social issues,\nlike same-sex marriage and\nwomen\u2019s rights, but are bound\n\nMichigander.\u201d\nSnyder echoed \u2014 similar\nsentiments Tuesday night,\n\nexpressing that divisiveness\nand constant blame should\nnot be the political norm. He\nwas instead optimistic that the\nstate could overcome political\nbarriers to work together.\n\n\u201cWe can raise the standard\nof how politics should operate\nin this country,\u201d he said.\n\nYet his smaller margin of\nvictory four years later may\nreflect criticisms that he too\noften broke from his promise\nto avoid promoting partisan\nissues.\n\n\u201cThere were some things\nthat happened in (Snyder)\u2019s\nfirst term that showed he\ncould be quite political, so he\ndidn\u2019t have the same kind of\nindependent persona that he\n\nSupport for President Barack\n\nObama and the auto industry\nbailout also featured prom-\n\ninto the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhat folks want, I found\nwas all common, regardless of\nwhere you are in Michigan,\u201d he\ntold the crowd during his vic-\ntory speech Tuesday evening.\n\u201cPeople want to have a fair\nwage for a fair day\u2019s work. They\n\nneighborhoods. And when it is\nall said and done, people want\nbe able to retire with dignity.\nAnd as Democrats, that is what\nwe have stood for since day one\nand we will continue to stand\nfor days in the future.\u201d\n\nWhile some candidates have\nsought to distance themselves\nfrom Obama and his policies,\none prominent one in Michigan\nbeing the auto bailout, Peters\nhas not. He was the only Senate\ncandidate to have the president\n\nby the principle of conservative\nfiscal policy.\n\nCunningham said being a\nconservative in left-leaning Ann\nArbor is difficult.\n\n\u201cI really wish that I could\nbe much more open about my\npolitical views and I wish that\npeople would be more willing\nto dialogue with me because I\nthink we have so much more in\ncommon with Democrats, espe-\ncially as young Republicans,\nthan most people think we do,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nLSA senior Gabe Leaf, chair\nof the University\u2019s chapter of\nthe College Republicans, said\nhe was chiefly concerned with\nreducing unemployment and\nexpanding Michigan\u2019s economy.\nHis vote for Snyder stemmed\nfrom the governor\u2019s gradual\nincreases in funding higher edu-\ncation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Michigan man him-\nself,\u201d Leaf said. \u201cHe comes from\nus; he knows what we\u2019ve been\nthrough, the kind of struggles\nare for higher education to oper-\nate, and he\u2019s also a businessman\nso he knows how to run these\nthings more effectively.\u201d\n\nLSA junior Stephen Culbert-\nson, communications director\nfor College Democrats, said he\nbelieved the Democratic Party\nhad a better understanding of\n\ndid in the first election, and\nthat cost him the mobilized\nDemocrats,\u201d Political Science\nProf. Mike Traugott said in an\ninterview with The Michigan\nDaily.\n\nIn the legislature\u2019s lame\nduck session in December\n2012, Snyder signed right-to-\nwork legislation into law, out-\nlawing union requirements\nfor members to pay dues as\na condition of employment.\nThe\nSnyder signed a measure ban-\n\nfollowing December,\n\nning abortion coverage from\nprivate health plans, instead\nrequiring women who wanted\nsuch a plan to purchase sup-\nplemental insurance. He has\nalso declined to take a per-\nsonal stance on gay marriage,\nchoosing instead to defer to\nthe pending decision in feder-\n\nhost a rally for him this election\nseason.\n\nIn the night\u2019s other big race,\nDemocrats were less successful;\nincumbent governor Rick Sny-\nder (R) held onto his seat. Peters\nsaid, as state representative, he\nhas already worked with Sny-\nder on building a new bridge\nbetween the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that I think is\n\neducation issues. He also appre-\nciated U.S. Representative-elect\nDebbie Dingell\u2019s advocacy for\nMichigan jobs and women\u2019s\nissues.\n\nal appeals court on the state\u2019s\n\nban on same-sex marriage.\nThe\n\nattempted to\n\nSchauer campaign\ndifferentiate\nfrom Snyder on those issues,\nand argued that the Gover-\nnor\u2019s decisions to lower the\nbusiness tax and raise taxes on\nretirees hurt the middle class.\nSchauer also sharply criticized\nSnyder for cutting both K-12\nand higher education funding\nin his first budget \u2014 though\nboth funds have increased in\neach of the budgets since.\n\nIn a concession speech\nTuesday night, Schauer reiter-\nated his commitment to those\nissues.\n\n\u201cWe fought hard,\u201d he told\nthe crowd. \u201cWe left it all on the\nfield. We made this race about\nour kids, about seniors, about\nour middle class, about work-\n\nvitally important for the state of\nMichigan, really for the whole\ncountry, to increase trade\nbetween the U.S and Canada\nand I\u2019ve worked with Governor\nSnyder on that, and should he\nbe successful tonight we\u2019ll con-\ntinue to work together,\u201d Peters\ntold the media on working\ntogether with Snyder before the\nrace was called.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the results\nare a bit disappointing, there is a\nlot to look forward to with Gary\nPeters and Debbie Dingell in\nWashington,\u201d he said. \u201dI think\n\ning people.\u201d\n\nHe said he was disappoint-\ned, but not discouraged, by the\nresults.\n\n\u201cThis was not just about\n2014,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a\nmovement about the future of\nour state. IfI learned one thing\nduring this campaign, it\u2019s that\nthe people of Michigan never\ngive up. When we get knocked\ndown, we get right back up.\nFor me, this campaign is over.\nBut for all of us as Democrats,\nas Michiganders who love our\ngreat state, this work must and\nwill continue.\u201d\n\nCollege Republicans Presi-\ndent Gabe Leaf, an LSA senior,\nsaid he has been happy with\nSnyder\u2019s work in higher educa-\ntion, despite public criticism.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really putting a focus\non education,\u201d Leaf said. \u201cHe\u2019s\n\nHe will join U.S Senator Deb-\nbie Stabenow (D-MI), now the\nstate\u2019s senior senator, in Con-\ngress. In replacing Levin, Peters\ntold the media that he would\nseek to continue expressing the\nvalues Levin brought to the job.\n\n\u201cI look forward...to serv-\ning in the Senate, building up\nseniority and doing the hard\nwork necessary for Michigan\n\nthey can represent Michigan\nvery well. They will be tremen-\ndous advocates for Michigan-\nders and the middle class, so\nthat\u2019s a big bright spot tonight.\u201d\n\na Michigan man himself so he\ncomes from us, he knows what\nwe\u2019ve been through, the kind\nof struggles are for higher edu-\ncation to operate and he\u2019s also\na businessman, so he knows\nhow to run these things more\neffectively.\u201d\n\nIn closing his victory speech\nTuesday night, Snyder made a\ncommitment to carry over the\nenergy of reinvention into his\nsecond term.\n\n\u201cThe passion, the fire, the\nexcitement, the conviction to\ndo the reinvention that you\u2019ve\nseen this Tuesday, I\u2019m going to\nhave it on Wednesday, Thurs-\nday, Friday and for the next\nfour years,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Shoham\n\nGeva and Emma_ Kinery\n\ncontributed reporting.\n\nand that means being a prac-\ntical, common sense problem\nsolver,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing\nabout Carl Levin, is it\u2019s about\ndoing the job with integrity and\nthoughtfulness. And I look for-\nward to following his footsteps\nand doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Gene-\nvieve Hummer contributed to\nthis report.\n\nRace for regent\ntoo close to call\n\nRepublicans lead\nin early results,\nbut Democrats\nremain hopeful\n\nBy CLAIRE BRYAN and\nALLANA AKHTAR\nDaily Staff Reporters\n\nAs of 2 a.m. Wednesday, the\nrace for two contested spots\non the University\u2019s Board of\nRegents was too close to call.\n\nRepublicans Rob Steele and\nRonald Weiser lead with 596,732\nand 594,196 votes, respective-\nly, compared to Democrats\nMike Behm\u2019s 440,903 votes\nand incumbent Kathy White\u2019s\n477,101 votes.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning,\nthe Michigan Secretary of State\nhad yet to release final tallies\nfrom several counties, including\nthe heavily Democratic Genesee\nand Wayne Counties that con-\ntain Flint and Detroit.\n\nIn 2012, the final election\nresults were not determined\nuntil the following day. In that\nyear, the two Republican can-\ndidates led for most of the early\nmorning hours, but fell to Dem-\nocrats once votes from Wayne\nCounty were tallied.\n\nThe board\u2019s two open seats\nare currently held by Regent\nJulia Darlow (D), who is not\nseeking reelection, and White.\n\nWhite, who currently serves\nas chair of the Board of Regents,\nis a professor of law at Wayne\nState University Law School in\nDetroit, an instructor of law at\nthe United States Military Acad-\nemy at West Point in New York\nand a Lieutenant Colonel in the\nUnited States Army Reserve.\n\nWeiser founded McKinley\nAssociates, a commercial real\nestate company, and served on\nmultiple boards for nonprof-\nit organizations including the\nUnited Negro College Fund of\nWashtenaw County, the Henry\nFord Museum in Dearborn and\nthe Detroit Institute of Arts.\nHe also served as the Amer-\nican ambassador to the Slo-\nvak Republic under the Bush\nAdministration.\n\nSteele, a University Inteflex\nprogram alum, is a cardiologist\nat St. Joseph Mercy Health Sys-\ntem in Ypsilanti and served as\na clinical assistant professor at\nthe University for more than 20\nyears.\n\nBehm works as a litigator in\nFlint and served as president of\nthe Michigan Association for\nJustice in 2011, a trade asso-\nciation. He worked on former\nSecretary of State Hillary Clin-\nton\u2019s presidential campaign and\nserved as a delegate to the Dem-\nocratic National Convention in\n2008.\n\nThe eight-member board is\nelected for eight-year terms on\nthe statewide ballot. The board\nis currently composed of six\nDemocrats and two Republi-\ncans.\n\nIn 2012, Democrats Mark\nBernstein and Shauna Ryder\nDiggs won the two open seats\non the board, carried to victory\nin part by the presidential race\nat the top of the ticket. Similar-\nly, Republicans Andrea Fischer\nNewman and Andrew Richner\nwon the election in 2010, a year\nthat saw low Democratic turn-\nout and the election of Republi-\ncan Goy. Rick Snyder.\n\nIn this election cycle, all four\nmajor-party candidates empha-\nsized affordability in their plat-\n\nforms, but differed on their\nplans for its execution.\n\nSteele had said he planned to\nfinance student loans by tapping\ninto the University\u2019s endow-\nment, while White said she\nintended to strengthen financial\naid. Behm and Weiser see the\nUniversity\u2019s satellite campuses\nin Dearborn and Flint as addi-\ntional, more affordable options\nfor students and said they plan\nto strengthen these campuses.\n\nEarlier this month, the candi-\ndates met for a candidate forum\nat the Gerald R. Ford School of\nPublic Policy to discuss a variety\nof University issues, including\ncampus climate, the institution\u2019s\nresponse to sexual assault and\nworking with the city of Detroit.\n\nMost of the candidates shared\nsimilar views on these issues,\nsuch as going to greater lengths\nto aid survivors of sexual assault\nand working to increase diver-\nsity among students within\nthe boundaries of Proposal 2,\nthe 2006 ballot initiative that\nbanned consideration of race in\ncollege admissions. Behm also\nexpressed support for the Uni-\nversity\u2019s financial divestment\nfrom fossil fuel companies.\n\nIn the last year, the regents\nhave been involved in several\nsignificant decisions, including\nthe appointment of University\nPresident Mark Schlissel.\n\nPolitical Science Prof. Vin-\ncent Hutchings said regent\ncandidates typically don\u2019t gain\nas much publicity compared to\nother races.\n\n\u201cThese lower-level offices put\na bigger burden on the voter,\u201d\nHutchings said. \u201cIt is harder\nfor people to gain information\nabout these people because\ninformation in the media is less\nplentiful.\u201d\n\nCynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-\nvice president\n\nversity\u2019s for\n\ngovernment relations, ran\nunsuccessfully for regent in\n1986.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience, but\nI think what you learn quickly is\nthat the visibility of the regent\nraces is really pretty low in the\nelectorate,\u201d she said.\n\nFor that reason, Wilbanks\nsaid the results in regents races\nare sometimes driven by the top\nof the ticket, particularly when\nvoters cast straight-ticket bal-\nlots.\n\n\u201cStraight party ticket voting\nmay happen a little more fre-\nquently when you are down at\nthe bottom of the ballot,\u201d Wil-\nbanks said. \u201cThat historical pat-\ntern has held true.\u201d\n\nIna telephone interview with\nThe Michigan Daily, Regent\nEmeritus Frederick C. Matthaei\nsaid he does not think parti-\nsanship plays a large role in the\nfunctioning of the board.\n\nMatthaei was appointed\nto the Board in 1967 after the\nresignation of his father, the\nnamesake of the Universi-\nty\u2019s botanical gardens. He ran\nfor reelection a year later as a\nRepublican nominee, but lost\nwhen Democratic presidential\ncandidate Hubert Humphrey\ncarried the state.\n\n\u201cT think their political party\nis important only because they\nhave to run through it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want eight regents to\nbe all on the same party. I think\nit\u2019s good to have a variety of edu-\ncated people, number one, and\nnumber two, it\u2019s a question of\nhow good their personal expe-\nriences could be for serving as a\nregent, not what political party\nthey\u2019re in.\u201d\n"
