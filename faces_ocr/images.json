Rick Snyder\nwon reelection Tuesday, defeat-\ning Democratic challenger Mark\nSchauer ina closer-than-expect-\ned campaign.\n\nWith most precincts in the\nstate reporting, Snyder captured\n51 percent of the vote compared\nto Schauer\u2019s 47 percent. In the\nlast few days before the election,\nSnyder and Schauer were close\nin the polls with the Detroit Free\nPress reporting a two-point lead\nin Snyder\u2019s favor on Oct. 29.\n\nIn his victory speech at the\nRenaissance Center in Detroit\nTuesday night, Snyder empha-\nsized the economic trouble the\nstate had long endured and his\nefforts to fundamentally change\nits course.\n\n\u201cOur spirit was being broken,\u201d\n\nSnyder said. \u201cIt was not the time\nto fix Michigan; that was not\ngoing to be good enough. It was\ntime to reinvent Michigan.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Snyder said\nthere was plenty of evidence of\nan economic turnaround. He\npointed to the creation of nearly\n300,000 private sector jobs, the\nincrease in the value of Michi-\ngan homes and the greater num-\nber of college graduates taking\njobs in the state as indicators of\nsuccess.\n\nYet despite Snyder\u2019s belief\nin the success of his first term,\nhe maintained there was much\nwork to be done in the next four\nyears.\n\n\u201cWhen you have success like\nthis what\u2019s the next thing you\nneed to do? It\u2019s not to stay com-\nplacent, it\u2019s time to accelerate\nand go even faster,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nSnyder hinted at some of\nhis goals for his second term,\nlike filling tens of thousands of\nskilled trade jobs, helping young\npeople connect with education\nopportunities and improving\naccess to career technical edu-\ncation, all of which he hopes will\nlead to more well-paying middle\nclass jobs.\n\nFour years after running on\n\na pledge to reinvent Michigan\u2019s\neconomy, Snyder was able to\nsecure a second term largely\non his fulfillment of that prom-\nise. His supporters point to his\nhands-on approach to Detroit\u2019s\nrecovery as a signature accom-\nplishment of his first term. The\nstate legislature, the city and its\ncreditors and pensioners struck\na Grand Bargain that allowed\nthe city to move ahead with its\nbankruptcy proceedings, which\nwill wrap up this month.\n\nOn higher education, Snyder\ncut state funding in 2011 with\nthe promise to raise it again in\nsubsequent years. He has incre-\nmentally increased the funding\nbut has yet to return it to the 2011\nlevels. Consequently, Schauer\nattempted to brand himself as\nthe \u201ceducation governor\u201d in his\ncampaign, calling for its funding\nto be restored to pre-2011 levels\nupon election to office.\n\nIn terms of the statewide\neconomy, Snyder repealed the\nMichigan Business Tax and\nreplaced it with a flat tax to\nappeal to new businesses, and\neach of his last two budgets\nhave resulted in a surplus. Addi-\ntionally, the state\u2019s 7.2-percent\n\nSee SNYDER, Page 4A\n\nIn dark day\n\nDemocratic U.S.\nSenate candidate\nbucks national\ntrend\n\nBy SHOHAM GEVA\nDaily Staff Reporter\n\nU.S. House Rep.

In the 12th U.S. House\nDistrict, the Detroit Free Press\nhas called the race for Debbie\nDingell, wife of current U.S.\nHouse Rep. John Dingell (D).\n\nShe is the third Dingell to hold\na Michigan Congressional seat,\nfollowing current Rep. John\nDingell and his father, John\nDingell, Sr.\n\nIn avictory speech at the state\nDemocrat watch party Tuesday\nnight in Detroit, Dingell thanked\nher staff, family and campaign,\nand said there were two people\nshe wanted to thank specifically\nby name: her husband, outgoing\n\nRep. Dingell, and outgoing U.S\nSenator Carl Levin.\n\n\u201cThese Democrats, two giants\nof men...have served this state\na very very long time,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd what we have to remember\nis that they\u2019ve been the voice of\nMichigan\u2019s values, of respecting\nworking men and women and\nstanding firm for what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nDingell faced off against\nRepublican candidate Terry\nBowman, a Ford employee and\nkey player in the 2012 right-\nto-work battle in the state. She\nmade higher education, namely\nreducing student debt, a key\nfocus, hosting higher educa-\ntion roundtables at universities\nacross the state to discuss issues\nfacing students and universities.\n\nDingell, who serves as a trust-\nee at Wayne State University\nrecently voted against a tuition\nincrease at that institution.\n\n\u201cT\u2019ve been on the Wayne State\nboard for eight years,\u201d Dingell\nsaid in a June interview with\n\nThe Michigan Daily. \u201cEvery sin-\ngle year, it seems like it\u2019s becom-\ning more challenging and more\ndifficult and harder to afford\na higher education. And every\nsingle day, I am meeting young\npeople who are graduating with\n\nstaggering debt.\u201d\nA founder of the National\nWomen\u2019s\u2019 Health Resource\n\nCenter, Dingell also champi-\noned affordable health care and\ninvesting in health research that\nincludes women, and advocated\nfor policies that extend rights to\nsame-sex couples.\n\n\u201cIf two people love each other,\nwhy should we keep them from\nbeing with each other?\u201d Ding-\nell said in an October interview\nwith The Michigan Daily.\n\nIn her victory speech Tues-\nday night, Dingell touched on all\nthose areas, also emphasizing\njob creation in the state.\n\n\u201cWe're going to keep fighting\nahead for the values we all care\nabout- to protect manufactur-\ning, that if you are sick you don\u2019t\nworry about whether you need\nto go to a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\nthat our children, 25 percent of\nour population and 100 percent\nof our future, they deserve qual-\nity, affordable education. That\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m fighting for. That\u2019s\nwhat I stand here for tonight.\u201d\n\nIn a October interview with\nthe Daily, she said the 2008\nfinancial crash heavily impacted\nthe job market, which, unlike\nthe auto industry, has not recov-\nered. Dingell has highlighted the\nimportance of job creation espe-\ncially for young college gradu-\nates and those forced into early\nretirement.\n\nIn an October interview with\nThe Michigan Daily, Bowman\nemphasized his distance from\nWashington as one benefit of\nhim taking the congressional\nseat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fault of the individual,\nbut I think that if you\u2019re in Con-\ngress for a long time you com-\npletely lose the ability to connect\nwith what goes on each and\nevery day,\u201d he said.\n\nIncumbents keep seats\nin midterm elections\n\nRepublicans\nmaintain hold in\nexecutive office\n\nBy GOVERNMENT BEAT\n\nMichigan Republicans held\ntheir posts statewide, winning\nthe Attorney General and Sec-\nretary of State races and push-\ning Governor Rick Snyder to\nreelection. Meanwhile, Ann\nArbor district-level Democrat-\nic politicians maintained their\nhold on the U.S. House of Rep-\nresentatives, Michigan House\nof Representatives and Michi-\ngan State Senate.\n\nAttorney General\n\nMichigan Attorney General\nBill Schuette (R) will retain his\nseat, besting Democrat Mark\nTotten. As of 2 a.m. Wednesday\nmorning, unofficial election\nresults showed that Schuette\nled Totten 52.1 percent to 44.2\npercent.\n\n\u201cI will continue to serve as\na voice for the constitution,\nbecause there are cops and\nfirefighters who worked hard\nin a tough city whose pensions\nwere at risk,\u201d Schuette said ina\nspeech at the Renaissance Cen-\nter Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI am an optimist at the core,\nand this election is all about\ntomorrows,\u201d Schuette said. \u201cI\nam confident Michigan\u2019s best\ntomorrows are just ahead. \u201c\n\nSchuette, who outspent Tot-\nten by a near six-to-one margin\nduring the campaign, has said\nhe would like to be a \u201cvoice for\nvictims\u201d of all crimes in his\nsecond term.\n\nFormerly a_ federal pros-\necutor, Totten emphasized his\ndesire to protect Michigan citi-\nzens from economic crime. He\nalso aimed to better support\nwomen\u2019s and students\u2019 rights,\ntwo areas in which he said\nSchuette failed.\n\nIn his first term, Schuette\n\nhas attempted to protect the\nstate\u2019s ban on same-sex mar-\nriage and its ban on affirmative\naction.\n\nSecretary of State\n\nSecretary of State Ruth\nJohnson (R) kept her seat\nagainst Democratic challeng-\ner Godfrey Dillard. Unoffi-\ncial election results indicated\nJohnson led Dillard 53.5 per-\ncent to 42.9 percent at 2 a.m.\n\nJohnson\u2019s reelection cam-\npaign emphasized her work in\ncustomer service and expand-\ning the department\u2019s online ser-\nvices. She previously worked as\nthe clerk and register for deeds\nin Oakland County.\n\nDillard, a Detroit attorney,\nannounced his campaign in\nAugust. Following his defeat,\nhe said his campaign stint was\nstill impactful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not discouraged,\u201d Dil-\nlard said. \u201cI think as I go for-\nward Ill keep looking for ways\nI can serve the citizens of\nMichigan.\u201d\n\nMichigan State Senate\n\nState Sen.

Previously, Warren\nserved in the Michigan House\nof Representatives from 2007\nto 2010.\n\nIn her tenure, Warren has\nfocused on women\u2019s rights and\nenvironmental protection. In\nSeptember, she co-introduced\nlegislation to require all health\ninsurance companies to pro-\nvide the option to purchase\nabortion service coverage. She\nhas also sponsored legislation\nto help sexual assault survi-\nvors, gender pay equity and\nworks to extend workplace\nfamily medical leave.\n\nWarren is invested in\nimproving the environment. In\n\nMay, she demanded with other\npoliticians to cease oil and gas\ndrilling in nearby Scio Town-\nship.\n\nWarren has also fought to\nimprove state support for both\nK-12 and higher education.\n\nLinden, her challenger, was\nnot available to media during\nthe campaign.\n\nMichigan House\nof Representatives\n\nState representative Jeff\nIrwin (D-Ann Arbor) has won\nreelection for a third term,\ndefeating Republican challeng-\ner John Spisak.\n\nIrwin has pushed for greater\nstate involvement in all levels\nof education and has argued\nthat improving the state\u2019s edu-\ncational institutions can be a\nmeans of economic growth. In\nApril 2013, Irwin proposed a\nbill to extend in-state tuition\nequality to undocumented\nstudents, a move hailed by on-\ncampus student groups.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good state pol-\nicy to try to keep those people\nhere in Michigan, giving them\nopportunity to contribute to\nour economy and communi-\nties,\u201d Irwin said in a 2013 inter-\nview with the Daily.\n\nHe has also been an advo-\ncate for improved environ-\nmental protections, and\nsupports increased investment\nin infrastructure to aid eco-\nnomic recovery.\n\nSpisak, an Ann Arbor resi-\ndent, is a stay-at-home father\nwho previously owned small\nbusinesses.

    "a-10.png": "| 4B | Wednesday, November 5, 2014 // The Statement\n\nRUBY WALLAU/ Daily\n\narly on a Saturday, students and faculty\n\nboarded a bus outside the University\u2019s\n\nSchool of Public Health. The destination\n\u2014 Detroit.\n\nHowever, this group wasn\u2019t going to visit the\ntourist hotspots. While Eastern Market and the\nRenaissance Center were on the itinerary, these\nparticipants had signed up to see some of the\nmost polluted and industrialized areas of the\ncity, hear about the historic factors that brought\nthe city to its current state and to learn about\nthe public health concerns for residents in these\nareas.\n\n\u201cDetroit\u2019s a challenging place \u2014 it\u2019s an inter-\nesting place,\u201d said Sociology Prof. Reynolds Far-\nley, one of the trip leaders for the 2014 Tour of\nToxic Sites, sponsored by the University\u2019s Center\nfor Occupational Health and Safety Engineering.\n\nFor better or worse, the city has for decades\nbeen used as a case study for some of society\u2019s\nmost serious economic and social concerns.\nFrom the collapse of the auto industry to the his-\ntory of racial tensions, academics use Detroit as a\nmodel for other similar U.S. cities.\n\nThe annual tour seeks to provide future pub-\nlic health and social justice workers with a first-\nhand look at contemporary issues, reflecting\nthe University\u2019s growing involvement \u2014 both\nacademically and socially \u2014 in the city in recent\nyears.\n\nAs the bus and its 30 to 40 passengers left Ann\nArbor, Farley began discussing the impact of the\ncity\u2019s history on the current environmental con-\ncerns.\n\nThe rise of an industrial giant\n\nFounded as a trading post in the early 16th\ncentury, Detroit saw significant population and\nindustrial growth starting in 1855 with the com-\npletion of two major projects \u2014 a railroad con-\nnecting the city to New York and Chicago and\nthe completion of the locks at Sault Ste. Marie,\nputting Detroit in the position to utilize Michi-\ngan\u2019s industrial resources \u2014 white pine, iron ore\nand copper \u2014 to become an industrial power-\nhouse.\n\nThe Civil War spurred demand for such\nindustrial products, and the city grew from a\npopulation of 21,000 in 1850 to almost 300,000\nby 1900.\n\nThe industrial boom marked the start of\nmajor pollution problems in the city and region.\nLong before the era of government regula-\ntion and oversight, manufacturers often simply\ndumped industrial waste into the Detroit River\nor let it soak into the ground around the plants\nthat produced them. Some of those toxic effects\ncan still be felt today.\n\nBut any industrial \u2018boom\u2019 of the 19th century\npales in comparison with the growth of industry\nin the early 20th century as Detroit gave birth to\nthe U.S. auto industry. The \u2018Big 3\u2019 automakers \u2014\nFord, General Motors, and Chrysler \u2014 all set up\nshop in the city.\n\nIn 1917, Ford Motor Co. began construction\non its River Rouge Complex, the single larg-\nest industrial complex in the world at the time.\nAt its height, it employed more than 100,000\nworkers and still operates in a limited capac-\nity today, though it was sold by the Ford family\nand has been downsized due to environmental\nrestrictions. The company now operates several\nmodern plants in the surrounding area and in\n\nDearborn. According to the Sierra Club, a nation-\nal environmental preservation group founded\nin 1892, these plants produced over 600,000\npounds of toxic pollutants in 2010, contributing\nthe \u201clargest burden of environmental pollution\u201d\nin Detroit.\n\nGeneral Motors opened a Cadillac assembly\nplant near Mexicantown in 1921 and later relo-\ncated to their Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly\nfacility north of the city in 1985. The company\npurchased the iconic waterfront Renaissance\nCenter in 1996 to serve as its world headquarters.\nAccording to the Sierra Club, the Hamtramck\nfacility produced over 180,000 pounds of toxic\nreleases and over 240,000 pounds of other waste\nin 2010.\n\nFarley noted that recognizing the city\u2019s his-\ntory is vital to understanding its continuing\nstruggles.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t spend a whole lot of time think-\ning about cities and how the history of cities,\nwhen homes were built and factories were built,\nhow that influences the present,\u201d Farley said.\n\u201cBut, they\u2019re open to thinking about it; they seem\nto be interested.\u201d\n\nThe grassroots movement\n\nAfter a brief tour of downtown and lunch at\nEastern Market, students and faculty boarded\nthe Toxic Tour bus for the main event \u2014 a look\nat some of the most polluted and industrialized\nareas of the city.\n\nCharles Stokes works for Detroiters Work-\ning for Environmental Justice, an organization\npartnered with the University\u2019s School of Public\nHealth, and joined the bus tours to provide stu-\n\ndents with context from a local resident\u2019s per-\nspective.\n\nStokes highlighted the pollution in Detroit as\nan environmental justice issue. In his position,\nhe works as an organizer spreading the word\nto afflicted neighborhoods about the dangers of\nvarious toxic sites and unite people to pressure\nthe city to make changes.\n\nAmong the many locations on the tour\u2019s itin-\nerary were the Rouge Steel Plant, the Marathon\nOil refinery, and the waste treatment plant.\nStokes explained how these locations contribute\nto carbon dioxide levels and other forms of air\npollution, as well as producing harmful indus-\ntrial byproducts, such as petroleum coke, during\nthe process of refining raw tar sands \u2014 mostly\nimported from Alberta, Canada \u2014 into oil.\n\nThe tour also visited the Detroit municipal\nwaste incinerator, a contentious topic in the\ncity for years and known for its infamous smell.\nStokes organized area residents to continu-\nally file odor complaints against the incinerator\nbased on reports that the smell has caused peo-\nple to feel nauseous and, in some cases, become\nmore seriously ill.\n\nOpened in 1986, the waste incinerator is the\nlargest of its kind in the U.S., accommodating\nover 3,000 tons of garbage on a daily basis. Along\nwith the long-standing debate over the plant\u2019s\nodor, the facility also emits airborne substances,\nsuch as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and car-\nbon monoxide, which have created public health\nconcerns in the community.\n\nAfter the actions taken by residents and envi-\nronmental groups, Michigan\u2019s Department of\nEnvironmental Quality brought suit against the\nprivate company that now owns the incinerator.\nIn the past two weeks, the city passed a consent\nagreement mandating the operators update the\nincinerator\u2019s air ducts to reduce the odor within\ntwo years or face a fine.\n\nWhile the proceedings demonstrated the\nability of community groups to help rectify envi-\nronmental injustice in the city, the incinerator\nis only one of many such facilities that are wor-\nrisome to residents. Stokes said there is still\nplenty of work to be done, but that he is proud so\n\nfar with the progress. Additionally, he said\n\neducating University students is a key\n\npart of ensuring solutions for the\nfuture.\n\n\u201cWe stand on the shoulders\n\nof those who came before us\n\nand so I offer my shoulders\n\nfor those who would like\n\nto stand on them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the ear of\n\na bunch of \u2018world-changers,\u2019\n\nwhat I mean is those students,\n\ntheir future\u2019s not defined yet\n\nand so we\u2019re going to help instill\n\nsomething that is based in justice\n\nequality and participation of all peoples.\u201d\nEnvironmental injustice\n\nHistorically, industry and residential areas\nof Detroit were built in close proximity to one\nanother, as this made the most sense for work-\ners who needed to commute. Despite a modern\nunderstanding of the environmental concerns\ntoday, Farley said it can be difficult both politi-\ncally and financially to relocate people away\nfrom pollution sites.\n\nInstead, residents and grassroots organizers\nare working to have industry more strictly regu-\nlated. So far, the results are mixed, as facilities\nsuch as the Marathon Refinery have pledged to\nreduce emissions, while at the same time con-\ntinuing to increase their facility\u2019s output.\n\nAccording to a report from the Detroit Alli-\nance for Asthma Awareness, rates of asthma in\nthe city are three times the national average.\nSome have argued that Michigan\u2019s Department\nof Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environ-\nmental Protection Agency could be doing more\nto regulate industries.\n\nFurthermore, the Sierra Club contends that\nthe environmental impacts are not evenly dis-\ntributed among the state\u2019s population. Citing\nresearch from Natural Resources Prof. Paul\nMohai, the report indicates that over 80 percent\nof African-American students attend school in\nthe top decile of polluted areas in the state, as\nopposed to 44 percent of white students.\n\nAt the start of the auto boom in the 1920s,\nDetroit\u2019s population was over 95 percent white.\nThe middle class thrived under the plethora of\nskilled manufacturing jobs. By the end of the\n20th century, however, the demographics had\nundergone a massive shift. In 2010, Blacks made\nup over 82 percent of residents.\n\nWhile middle-class workers had the ability to\nmove to the suburbs or leave the city entirely, less\nadvantaged groups were left to deal with the fall-\nout of years of environmental degradation.\n\n\u201cThere were no incentives to cooperate on\nmajor issues, like economic development, trans-\n\nportation, education, or environmental protec-\ntion,\u201d Farley said. \u201cThe suburban communities\nwent their own way and competed with the city\nand ... city-suburban disputes often turned into\nnasty Black-white disputes.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Sierra Club Detroit referred to the\nenvironmental pollution in the city as a \u201chuman\nrights abuse\u201d and \u201cenvironmental injustice.\u201d\nGrassroots organizations, such as Detroiters\nWorking for Environmental Justice, have taken\non initiatives to improve underprivileged com-\nmunities.\n\n\u201cGiven the contamination of their immediate\nenvironments, these communities have inordi-\nnately high levels\n\nTAL JUSTICE IN DET\n\nFNIOR NEWS EDITORS\n[LLINGHAM & WILL GREENBERG\n\nof asthma, cancer, neu-\nrological disorders and\nbirth defects,\u201d the Sierra\nClub report stated.\nDelray resident Forest\nHudson acknowledged that\npollution is a major concern\nin his area.\n\n\u201cThe area\u2019s a dump, but I love it,\u201d Hudson\nsaid. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of toxic waste.\u201d\n\nAt the community center where he works,\nlines of smokestacks surround the soccer fields\nwhere children come for after-school activities.\nThe air smells of sulfur and garbage.\n\n\u201cTt\u2019s just background,\u201d Hudson said, referenc-\ning the close proximity of the industry.\n\nBut he said people in\nthe community are fighting\nback, despite a seeming lack\nof involvement from city\nofficials. As Hudson puts\nit, people are \u201cfighting for\ntheir livelihood\u201d and there\nis an increasing effort to\nhold government officials\naccountable in remedying\nthe concerns.\n\nIn addition to industry,\nDelray lies in the midst of\nmajor trucking and ship-\nping routes near the USS.\nterminal for the Ambas-\nsador Bridge, a major thor-\noughfare of U.S.-Canadian\neconomic trade. As many\nas 9,000 trucks pass these\ncheckpoints each day.\n\nThe city has passed\nanti-idling laws to pro-\nhibit trucks waiting near\nthe bridge terminals from\ncontaminating surround-\ning neighborhoods with air\npollution, but these laws are\nrarely enforced by police.\nIn addition, reports indi-\ncate that the approach to\nthe Ambassador Bridge is |\nplagued by delays. |\n\nNow, there are plans to\nexpand such operations by\nopening a new bridge by\n2020 to accommodate larg-\n\nWednesday, November 5, 2014 // The Statement\n\ner trade volume. While these expansions seek to\nincrease the flow of traffic along one of the most\nimportant international trade rates, Hudson\u2019s\nhouse sits on land needed to build the U.S. cus-\ntoms plaza.\n\nHe said the city plans to buy his house next\nyear. Motioning to an image on the wall of the\ncommunity center, he said there were originally\nplans to build a community for the displaced\nresidents, but those plans fell through \u2014 the area\nproposed for housing was deemed more appro-\npriate for expanding industry.\n\nAs for his community, Hudson said he\u2019s\nunsure if their efforts to garner aid from the city\nwill yield results.\n\n\u201cTt\u2019s only a mat-\nter of time before\nwe know one way\n\nor another whether\nthey take our con-\ncerns seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nNeighborhood negotiations\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Detroit made its mark as an\nindustrial giant, and with industry comes pol-\nlution. However, as Detroiters argue, pollution\nin the city is no longer simply an environmental\nconcern, but a social disparity as well.\n\nThe city\u2019s population has shrunk from nearly\ntwo million at its height in the 1950s to about\n700,000 today. Those that remain do so for a\nvariety of reasons \u2014 some feel loyal to the city\nwhile others lack the resources to move else-\nwhere. Regardless, the shifting demographics\nmean that those responsible for creating a toxic\n\nenvironment are not the ones suffering from its\neffects.\n\nThe collapse of the auto industry and subse-\nquent municipal bankruptcy have resulted in the\ndownsizing or closure of some of Detroit\u2019s most\niconic facilities \u2014 such as Ford\u2019s River Rouge\nplant \u2014 which are replaced with newer, decen-\ntralized production models. At the new Ford\ncomplex, environmental efforts are underway\nto limit emissions and protect water sources.\nThe new facility boasts one of the largest \u201cliving\nroofs\u201d in the world, using natural grasses and\nplants to reduce the plant\u2019s energy consumption\n\u2014 a promising effort toward increasing environ-\nmentally minded industry around the city.\n\nOther companies have developed their own\nstrategies for dealing with increasing environ-\nmental regulation.\n\nIn Oakwood Heights, a few residents are\nholding out against Marathon Petroleum Co.,\nwhich has bought homes from over 300 residents\n\u2014 paying an average of $65,000 per home \u2014 as\npart of a plant expansion effort. By removing\nresidents, the company can effectively increase\nits distance from residential areas, bypassing\ncertain restrictions based around proximity to\nhomes.\n\nBy simply refusing to sell their homes, these\nresidents have been thrust into the middle of a\ndebate that will likely continue for years to come.\nAnd, in a city that has historically faced some\nof the most impactful racial conflicts of mod-\nern USS. history, the next chapter of such debate\nmay not come in the form of protest and politi-\ncal uprising, but in the billows of smoke that have\nlong symbolized Detroit\u2019s industrial might.\n\nDETROIT INCINERATOR\n\nTHE TOXIC TOUR\n\nFORD PLANT\n\nOAKWOOD HEIGHTS\n\nMARATHON REFINERY\n\nDETROIT\n\nAMBASSADOR BRIDGE\n\nDELRAY\n\nZUG ISLAND\n\nWASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nRIVER ROUGE :\n",
    "a-11.png": "| 6B | Wednesday, November 5, 2014 // The Statement\n\nDo U.S. colleges have something to learn from German tuition policy?\nby Rachel Premack\n\nen German universities began\n\ncharging tuition in 2006, the back-\n\nlash was swift. At the University of\n\nFreiburg, where University of Michigan His-\n\ntory Department Chair Kathleen Canning\n\nwas administering a study abroad program in\n\nthe 2000s, students occupied classrooms and\n\nhung enormous banners that read, \u201cEducation\nis a human right.\u201d\n\nThe fees that caused the outrage? An aver-\nage of $630 per semester. At this University,\nin-state LSA students pay $6,579 and out-\nof-staters pay $20,789.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much it was,\u201d\nCanning said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter that it was\naffordable for most middle-class fami-\nlies. It was the principal of introducing\ntuition.\u201d\n\nLucky for the students, the final Ger-\nman federal state abolished tuition in\nOctober. Now anyone \u2014 German citizen\nor not \u2014 can receive a free college educa-\ntion at one of Germany\u2019s globally lauded\nuniversities.\n\nPast German college students are now\namong world-renowned philosophers,\nresearchers, entrepreneurs, writers and\nleaders. The nation is the world\u2019s third-\nlargest importer and exporter. More\nNobel laureates are from Germany than\nany other nationality \u2014 save for the U.S.\nand U.K.\n\nSo why don\u2019t these students have to\npay the thousands of dollars per year that\nAmericans do?\n\nTuition in the United States has not\nalways been so high. At the University, adjust-\ning for inflation, in-state students paid $1,472\nin the 1969-1970 academic year. It rose, by\ndecade, to $1,970 in 1980, $3,065 in 1990 and\n$5,704 by 2000.\n\nJust as well, until the mid-20th century,\nhigher education was something attainable\nonly by the most elite social classes in Ger-\nmany.\n\n\u201cThe whole notion of buildings, education,\nwas a fundamental attribute of the bourgeoi-\nsie and the nobility,\u201d Canning said. \u201cIt was not\nsomething that anyone in the middle class or\nlower middle class could aspire to.\u201d\n\nUniversity education remains somewhat\nexclusive in Germany, though its hierarchical\nsystem is becoming easier to enter. In elemen-\ntary school, children take an exam that divides\nthem into one of three schools: gymnasium;\nrealschule or hauptschule. Only gymnasium is\nauniversity-preparatory school.\n\nGymnasium has become more accessible\nover the past few decades. According to Ger-\nman data portal Statista, 15 percent of students\nin 1952 were in gymnasium. By 2005, it was 33\npercent.\n\nThe increasingly open doors of the gym-\nnasium have caused a strain on universities\nthe past decade and a half, Canning said. Pro-\nfessorships are few. In the Frieburg history\ndepartment, for instance, Canning said there\n\nwere nine history professors. The University\nof Michigan has 90.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a second tier of what they call\nmid-career instructors who, however, have no\njob security and they\u2019re not even permanent\nlecturers like you would have here,\u201d Canning\nadded. \u201cThey\u2019re often filling in or actually\nteaching for free while hoping to get a profes-\nsorship somewhere else.\u201d\n\nJohannes von Moltke, associate profes-\nsor and chair of German, said, \u201cThere\u2019s over-\n\ncrowding in German universities. Because it\u2019s\nreally accessible, a lot of people study.\u201d\n\nRackham student Cristian Capotescu\nreceived his history degree from the Univer-\nsity of Freiburg in 2010. Lectures are not so\ndifferent in German schools than in the U.S.,\nCapotescu described, with packed lecture\nhalls of hundreds of students.\n\nWhere differences existed were in semi-\nnars and tutorials, the latter being something\nlike a class section with a greater emphasis on\nlearning how to better write, read, etc. Capo-\ntescu said graduate students often teach semi-\nnars, whereas here professors almost always\nlead them. Stranger yet, undergraduates are\nwont to teach these tutorials.\n\n\u201cThe quality of those sections are a lot\nlower,\u201d Capotescu said. \u201cI certainly think\ngraduate students are more qualified to teach\nthose sections, but is it worth $40,000 a year?\u201d\n\nThe ban on tuition in Germany was lifted in\n2006. Following that, various German states\nbegan issuing small semester fees to better its\nquality of education. Canning said the hugely\nunpopular tuition actually did not help condi-\ntions at university.\n\n\u201cEither they just conceded that it wasn\u2019t\nenough money to really do anything and it was\ntoo controversial to even bother with it,\u201d Can-\nning said.\n\nCapotescu agreed that 500 euros ($624.95)\n\nper semester was unlikely to break the bank;\nhowever, the implementation of tuition on\nprinciple could later prove difficult.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility that it could\nbe increased,\u201d Capotescu said. \u201cWe saw that\nin the U.S. that once higher tuition was intro-\nduced it kept increasing.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the average debt of a University\ngraduate was nearly $28,000, with 44 per-\ncent of the student body graduating with debt.\nMoreover, while the German government\n\nLUNA ANNA ARCHEY/Daily\ncontinues invest money in education, a mere 16\npercent of the University\u2019s budget come from\nstate appropriations.\n\n\u201cThe money we need grows and the money\nwe get shrinks,\u201d von Moltke said.\n\nAs recently as 1990, state funding and\ntuition contributed equally to the budget.\n\nCapotescu noted issues with a huge student\nbody, not unlike Germany.\n\n\u201cWe assume that with American educa-\ntion, you pay so much so it\u2019s better. When you\nlook closer at elite public higher education at\nschools like Michigan, it\u2019s not a perfect world\nor utopia,\u201d Capotescu said. \u201cYou still have 150\nstudents ina lecture.\u201d\n\nThe increased tuition did encourage a state\nof mind that does not exist in Germany. Amer-\nican college students view themselves as con-\nsumers at the University; we spend a certain\namount of money and expect a certain qual-\nity of service. German collegiates, though, are\n\u201cstudent-citizens,\u201d von Moltke explained.\n\nFor instance, career advising is more or less\nnon-existent in Germany. Students can use\ngovernment offices for these things. In fact,\nmost services like housing and public trans-\nportation for students are provided by the city\nor state.\n\n\u201cIts job is to serve the public, not to treat its\nstudents as clients,\u201d von Moltke said. \u201cFor bet-\nter and for worse, in the U.S., you are a paying\n\nclient and because of the way American capi-\ntalism works, customer service is part of the\nexperience... Of course it kind of commodifies\neducation. It becomes a good to be exchanged\nbetween a seller and buyer. Whereas in Ger-\nmany, the ideal is still it\u2019s a public good so\nyou\u2019re not paying or buying for it, you\u2019re taking\nadvantage of your right to education. But then\nit isn\u2019t kind of fenced in with all of these con-\nsumer bells and whistles.\u201d\n\nThat lack-of-consumer model is also\nreflected in the type of education students can\n\nexpect. Canning described three types of\nclasses: lectures and small, introductory and\nadvanced seminars.\n\nA first-year student in an introductory\nseminar on the French Revolution, Canning\ndescribed, would be expected to already\nknow the chronology of the Revolution, or\nreceive suggestions for background reading.\nThe course would focus on reading primary\nsources \u2014 in French \u2014 and discussing them.\n\nStudents in lecture courses rarely have\nperformance-based measurements, like\nquizzes or tests, at the end. Instead, stu-\ndents ask to take an oral exam with a profes-\nsor if they feel they know the material well\nenough.\n\n\u201cIf you bomb, it\u2019s your own fault and no\none cares,\u201d Canning said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody\nthere to hold your hand. It\u2019s up to you. You\u2019re\na scholar, you\u2019re at the university because\nyou want to actually learn. Our little \u2018holding\nout the carrot\u2019 just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nLSA junior Alexandra Trecha, who is\nstudying in Freiburg this year, noticed the\n\ndifference in expectations.\n\n\u201cThere definitely isn\u2019t as much \u2018checking in\u2019\nand students are expected to be much more\nresponsible and invested in their work here\ncompared to the U.S.,\u201d Trecha said.\n\nAt the University, students expect, well,\neverything from their college experience. The\nUniversity provides transportation, housing,\nfood, libraries, mental health support, aca-\ndemic and career advising and \u2014 perhaps most\nimportantly \u2014 a social scene.\n\nIn the U.S., the college years are supposed\nto be \u201cthe best time\u201d of your life. Germans see\ncollege as a continuation of one\u2019s education,\nas momentous as moving from tenth to 11th\ngrade. More fanfare surrounds moving away\nfrom home.\n\n\u201cTt\u2019s not the place you go and get away from\nyour parents for four years and drink and fig-\nure out who you are,\u201d Canning said.\n\nCapotescu noted that much soul-searching\nand deciding what one\u2019s talents are occurs in\nhigh school. Indeed, hopeful doctors in Ger-\nmany attend medical or law school directly\nafter high school rather than dabbling in biol-\nogy courses for two years before deciding to\nmajor in philosophy.\n\n\u201cCollege is a lot more functional,\u201d Capo-\ntescu said. \u201cYou go through university to get\nto ajob.\u201d\n\nTO READ MORE VISIT MICHIGANDAILY.COM\n",
    "a-12.png": "Wednesday, November 5, 2014 // The Statement\n\nPersonal Statement: Falling in love behind closed doors\n\ne met in the student jour-\nnalism office at our subur-\nban high school. She was\n\non the yearbook staff, a grade older;\nI was an editor for the newspaper. It\nwas like forbidden love. More on that\nlater.\n\nA year earlier, another newspa-\nper writer and I had lost a lengthy\nbattle with our high school\u2019s admin-\nistration over the fate of the news-\npaper class. Over time, we fought\ntheir decision to cut the class by\nreincarnating the newspaper as an\nafter school club. At that time, I had\nno idea how important this organi-\nzation, the office from which it was\nrun and everything that came out of\nit would be in my life.\n\nWe officially met on Valentine\u2019s\nDay: Feb. 14, 2011. It was sophomore\nyear: the year I had a crush on Dar-\nren Criss, worked backstage at my\nhigh school\u2019s production of Seussical\nthe Musical and took AP U.S. His-\ntory. Though I recognized her face\nfrom all of the afternoons I had spent\nin that office, writing and editing\nstories, we had never had a real con-\nversation before that day. In the years\nafter, I\u2019d forget the date of everything\nelse that happened, but I would never\nforgot that date.\n\nOur first conversation was about\n\u201cGlee,\u201d which we both watched reli-\ngiously. Maybe this is an unusual\n(and typically high school) way for\ntwo people to become best friends\n\u2014 but all it took was that conversa-\ntion for us to connect. Suddenly, we\n\nwere texting constantly and eating\nlunch together everyday in the jour-\nnalism office. In no time at all, I felt\nmore comfortable around her than\nanyone else; we shared our deepest\nsecrets and fears and dreams with\neach other and never, ever ran out of\nthings to talk about. In this friend-\nship, I found a deeper level of emo-\ntional intimacy than anything I had\never shared with another person. She\nwas the best friend that I\u2019d ever had.\n\nWith all the similarities that\nallowed us to become such close\nfriends, we were also incredibly dif-\nferent. She was outgoing, where I\nwas reserved; she loved taking pho-\ntographs, I loved to write. She was\nconfident and sure of herself while I\nworried too much about what others\nthought of me. Ultimately, the news-\npaper gave me this relationship. We\nbonded over the ridiculous amounts\nof time we devoted to our publica-\ntions. The school yearbook contin-\nued to win awards, while the school\nnewspaper struggled to stay alive.\nRegardless, we both did a lot of our\ngrowing up ina computer lab.\n\nWe kissed for the first time while\nwe were watching a documentary on\nSeptember 11. By this point, I was fill-\ning out college applications and had\nbeen promoted to editor in chief of\nthe now-monthly newspaper. She\nwas a freshman in college and had\nmoved several hours from home. It\nseemed like everything had changed\nsince I was a sophomore, but our\nfriendship endured it all.\n\nby Carolyn Gearig\n\nI'll never forget that moment. To\nthis day, I don\u2019t know who started it.\nWhat I do know is that I enjoyed it,\nit was completely unexpected and it\nhit me straight in the head with no\nwarning.\n\nThe following week was perhaps\nthe scariest time of my life. I had no\nidea what was happening: my world\nwas turned upside down. One week I\nconsidered myself to be straight and\nher to be my best friend; the next,\neverything was different. The idea\nof my friendship changing scared me\nshitless. She was the only one I want-\ned to talk to, yet she was the root of\nmy insecurities.\n\nSo began the coming out pro-\ncess: something I still can\u2019t stand. I\nhave never been ashamed or embar-\nrassed of my sexuality \u2014 whatever\nit is \u2014 but I hate the act of telling. I\nfeel like it is oftentimes similar to the\nfact that I have always worn glasses:\nsomething that is important to me, in\nsome ways, but mostly just a part of\nwho I am. I hate coming out because\nit makes me feel so vulnerable: what\nis to most people an afterthought is,\nto me, deeply personal. At the time, I\nhad no idea how to define my sexuali-\nty, unwilling to classify it as anything\nother than \u201cnot straight.\u201d I hated\nit, because I felt like I had to define\nit, though I wasn\u2019t sure what that\ndefinition was. I hated it, because of\nmy friends never had to come out as\nstraight. Coming out to each person\npresented a unique, complicated bat-\ntle with myself.\n\nAfter a lot of discussion and deep\nthinking, we decided to make our\nrelationship official, but I had no\none to share the happy news with.\nInstead, we started together on a\npath to self-discovery. I realized\nmore and more, as every minute went\nby, how strongly I had felt towards\nher. Though I previously had crushes\non boys, it was nothing compared to\nthe way I felt when she walked into a\nroom. Everything I had ever done, I\nwanted to do with her.\n\nOur relationship didn\u2019t survive\nmy senior year of high school, but\nsometimes I wonder if she would\nstill be in my life had we been in a\nboy-girl relationship. The pressures\nthat came from falling in love while\nkeeping it a secret and coming to\nterms with my own sexuality were\nimmense. This put pressures on our\nrelationship that no one should have\nto face. And being several hours\napart only made it that much worse.\n\nLooking back, all the signs were\nthere. We were close in a way I had\nnever been with any of my friends.\nBut I had always identified as\nstraight. Coming to terms with this\nchange in my identity was a process\nI still struggle with day in and day\nout. I have learned that sexuality is\na spectrum and is not as black and\nwhite as I previously thought.\n\nLuckily, I had several people\nwho stood by me throughout the\nordeal, and for that I cannot thank\nthem enough. I am blessed with\nopen-minded friends and family who\n\nGNVTIOHTINW NVOAW Ad NOILVALSNTII\n\naccepted and loved me for who I am.\nWithout these people, I don\u2019t know\nhow I would have made it through.\nFor those who I didn\u2019t tell until after\nthe fact, I was sorry. Trust me when\nI say that keeping it a secret wasn\u2019t\nwhat I wanted.\n\nUltimately, am I glad it hap-\npened? Our four months of happiness\nmeant more than I can say, but losing\nher as a friend because of it was sad-\nder than I can possibly describe. But\nin the process, I learned an incredible\namount about who I was and what I\nwanted from the rest of my life.\n\nNow, I work 20 hours a week\nfor a newspaper with a legitimate\nbudget and a circulation of 15,000.\nI\u2019m dating a boy. My high school\nself wouldn\u2019t recognize me now. I\u2019m\nhappier than I\u2019ve ever been but I am\noften reminded of how much easier\nmy second relationship is over the\nfirst. I\u2019ve never hesitated to hold his\nhand in public and I don\u2019t have to\nthink twice when telling new friends\nand acquaintances that I have a boy-\nfriend. \u2019m more aware than ever of\nthe privileges I have when I am with\nhim, and they are mind-blowing in\ncomparison. And it makes me sad.\nKeeping her a secret hurt more than\nanything.\n\nIf we were given a chance, who\nknows what would have happened?\nShe might still be in my life; we\nmight have been happily ever after.\nBut what remains is a new sense of\nstrength and confidence in who I am.\nNow, I am unafraid.\n",

Moments that told stories of where we were,\nand how the neighborhoods within Queens and Brooklyn are composed of both rich\nand poor areas living right next to each other. To put it simply, it was what Mary\nEllen, who has won three Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards, described as just\n\u201cAmerican.\u201d\n\nee\n\n",

Last Fri-\n\nDave Brandon\u2019s_resigna- vam -\\\ntion. He also appointed feo = |\nformer Steelcase CEO Jim =>\n\nHackett as the interim\nAthletic Director \u2014 key\n\nword interim.\n\nThat got me thinking and\nactually pretty excited. As\nof right now, I don\u2019t have\nany plans for next summer\nand should probably start working on intern-\nship and job applications sometime soon. The\nsearch process for the next athletic director\nhasn\u2019t begun yet either and anything you see\nor hear on the news is just hearsay at this\npoint. So before this opportunity slips away\nfrom me, I am officially announcing myself as\na candidate for the Athletic Director position\nat the University of Michigan.\n\nBefore I get written off as unqualified, let\nme explain. Mr. Hackett, feel free to use this\nas acover letter if it suits you.\n\nAt the press conference, Schlissel said the\nnew athletic director must be \u201ca person of\nunquestioned integrity, not just integrity to\nthe level of NCAA rules.\u201d\n\nFor starters, I\u2019ve never allegedly e-mailed\nan alumnus passive-aggressively telling them\nto \u201chave a happy life\u201d or \u201cstop drinking and go\nto bed.\u201d\n\nSecond, one of my professors referred to\nme as a \u201cgreat guy\u201d in office hours. If those\ntwo examples don\u2019t represent \u201cunquestioned\nintegrity,\u201d I\u2019m not sure what does. However,\nfor those still unconvinced about my qualifi-\ncations, please read on.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about my leadership\nskills, there\u2019s nothing to fear. Six people\nhave endorsed me on LinkedIn for \u201cleader-\nship,\u201d and admittedly, I\u2019m pretty proud of\nthat. Small sample size, yes. But I know those\npeople didn\u2019t hesitate for a second when\nthey hit the endorse button. That counts for\nsomething.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for someone who knows a\nthing or two about generating sales and build-\ning a brand, look no further. I have more than\n530 followers on Twitter \u2014 although most of\nthem think I play for the Denver Broncos. In\nthe business, we call that a dedicated follow-\ning. In my younger days, I ran some pretty\nsuccessful lemonade stands. And I never once\nconsidered raising the price to maximize rev-\nenue because I didn\u2019t want the community\n\nDEREK\nWOLFE\n\nROBERT SCHWARZHAUPT |\n\nto lose faith in me. A 25-cent glass, now and\nforever. To top it off, I\u2019ve never sold terrible\npizza. I think that wins a few H.A.I.L. points.\n\nSchlissel also mentioned that the next\nathletic director doesn\u2019t have to have\nMichigan ties. He reiterated this point in an\ninterview with the Daily on Monday, \u201cI\u2019m\nalways open to the idea that someone from\nthe outside might help us be even better. I just\nwant to get the best person.\u201d\n\nClearly, this is where I\u2019m at a little bit of\na disadvantage. I am a \u201cMichigan Man\u201d\nafter all \u2014 if having a University e-mail\naccount makes you one. However, I contend\nI would bring a nice balance to the Athletic\nDepartment.\n\nFirst off, I never played for legendary\nfootball coach Bo Schembechler. In fact, I\nnever played football. That being said, I\u2019ve still\nsucceeded in athletics. Though you might not\nbe able tell by looking at me, I was an integral\nmember of a championship basketball team\non my hometown\u2019s local recreational league\n\u2014 there were only seven players and my dad\nwas the coach. For this, I am, and will always\nbe, a winner. Sure, the last guy may have had\nthree Big Ten championship rings, but \u2019m\nalso confident I got more playing time than\nhe did.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve never worked in an athletic\ndepartment before, I\u2019ve been to my fair\nshare of football and basketball games. That\nshould suffice. I\u2019m also proficient in addition\nand subtraction so the budget stuff is no\nbig deal. Also, in case you forgot, I\u2019ve run a\nlemonade stand before. Can you say business\nexperience?\n\nI would bring a solid understanding of the\nstudent voice. Heck, when I want student\ninput on an issue all \u2019ll have to do is think.\nNo other candidate will be able to say that.\n\nWith that, I feel I\u2019ve covered all the bases.\nI might be the \u201cunorthodox\u201d candidate, but\nthat\u2019s what the University needs right now:\nSomeone who\u2019s not afraid to tell it how it is\nand enact necessary change. Someone with\nvision and relevant experience.\n\nLastFriday, whenasked about what qualities\nhe envisioned in the future athletic director,\nSchlissel responded, \u201cI have excellence\nin mind.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, and considering how the\nprevious Athletic Director performed, then I\nmust be the man for the job. Some might even\nsay I\u2019m overqualified. Just don\u2019t forget I can\u2019t\nstart until the summer.\n\nAcademics come first.\n\n\u2014 Derek Wolfe can be reached\nat dewolfe@umich.edu.\n\nInclusive language, only part of the solution\n\nIthink we need to have a talk about inclusive\nlanguage and its relation to social justice here\nat the University. With the new inclusive\nlanguage campaign kicking off, it\u2019s time we\nmake sure to keep things in perspective. First\nof all, I want to recognize my place of privilege\nin this area. I am a white presenting, middle\nclass, cisgender male who largely does not face\nthe mounting burden of micro-aggressions.\nAs always, it is important to keep that in mind\nas I only face micro-aggressions for my queer\nidentity, which does play a role in how I view\nthis topic. However, I\u2019d like to move forward\nas a student of social science, which will\ninform my thoughts.\n\nThe more social justice circles that I\u2019ve nav-\nigated through, the more I have come across\na fixation on making sure language is inclu-\nsive. People actively make an effort to correct\neach other in order to make sure their diction\nis properly inclusive. And while this prac-\ntice is valuable, and certainly necessary, I am\nbeginning to worry. Yes, language has a pow-\nerful effect in perpetuating unfair and unjust\nsystems, dynamics and institutions. Yes, lan-\nguage can be powerfully racist, sexist, bigoted\nand unintentionally hateful. Yes, language is\na subtle and subversive form of problematic\nconditioning. And yes, understanding and cor-\nrecting problematic language is one step in\ncreating an equitably functional society. How-\never, this newly growing modern view of strict\ninclusive language is proving more and more\ndangerous. Simply put, this massive amount\nof energy focused on only inclusive language\nin social justice spaces convinces people social\njustice issues can be fixed simply by applying\nstrict scrutiny to our words. Monitoring lan-\nguage to be more inclusive, while comforting,\nactually does very little to help fix the larger\noppressive macro-systems and institutions\nthat plague America and fuel injustice. Rath-\ner, inclusive language can be used to create a\nspace where interpersonal dialogue may lead\nto generating potential solutions to larger\n\nsocial problems. Inclusive language is simply\none method to facilitate the creation of spaces\nwhere diversity is at the center of the dialogue.\nHowever, in and of itself, inclusive language\ndoes very little to solve the larger problems\nthat fuel injustice in society on a mass scale.\n\nBefore I go on, I would like to be clear that\nmaking people comfortable in social settings\nis very important. However, let\u2019s not conflate\nthis with fixing systemic injustice. This\nmodern fixation on strict scrutiny of language,\nwhile well-intentioned, takes the focus away\nfrom realities of fixing our larger society and\nthe complex tasks associated with it. Fixing\nsocial justice issues will require complex\nadvocacy, coalition-building, research and\na real understanding of social dynamics,\npsychology and politics. It is unfortunate\nthat policing language is where social justice\nstarts and ends from many people, because\nit does nothing to help the real, pressing\nneeds. The modern practice of language\npolicing to be \u201cinclusive\u201d fails to recognize\nthe social politics of interpersonal education,\nmotivating political support and coalition-\nbuilding. Simply put, it turns many people\naway from social justice issues in a way that\ndoes nothing to build support or solve them.\n\nAgain, let me be clear in saying that\npeople should be held accountable to their\nwords. Language has a real effect on social\ninteractions, and everyone should strive to\nunderstand how their language can make\npeople feel, but we should be wary on its actual\nefficacy in solving the problems that have\nhuge effects on people\u2019s lives such as cyclical\npoverty and the achievement gap.\n\nUltimately, policing language is a subtle form\nof slacktivism and does very little in creating\nactual change in the way marginalized groups\nare institutionally oppressed.\n\nRobert Schwarzhaupt is an LSA senior\nand a Programming Board Member in\nthe Trotter Multicultural Center.\n\nWhen I abandoned beauty for strength\n\nwrong reasons.\nI heard it\nlook\n\nI started weightlifting for all the\n\nwill give me\n\nthe toned\nof Gisele.\n\nI heard it will\ngive me the ass\nof J. Lo.\n\nI heard it\nwill give me\nthe arms of\nJennifer Aniston.\n\nI heard it\nwill give me the\nslender legs of\nHeidi Klum.\n\nT heard it will give me the flat abs\nof Rihanna.\n\nI heard it will give me a body\nother than my own.\n\nA year ago, I listened to the\nmagazines, movies, celebrities,\nfriends and family that told me\nexercise could move my body far\naway from its current form. I pored\nover the advice and tips that detailed\nhow to lift small weights to achieve\nthe beauty ideal of the perfect\nfemale celebrity. They all directed\nme toward the same end goal \u2014 thin\nand toned. Alone with these voices,\nI had become fogged by the pursuit\nof changing my body beyond its\nnormal form.\n\nCreating my exercise plan started\nwith opening the expanding pull-\nouts from the middle of women\u2019s\nmagazines. Each pull-out displayed\na sequence of exercises done by\nwispy white women. They had no\nsweat, no creases, no fat and were\nholding only two-pound weights.\nA TV remote could have replaced\nthe weights they happily clutched.\nNowhere had I seen images\nof women lifting weights that\n\ndemanded real strength.\n\nThough I consumed these images\nwholeheartedly, they sent me dan-\ngerous messages. They informed me\nthat lifting weights should be done,\nironically, to not gain visible mus-\ncles. They told me that I should not\nbe \u201cbulky\u201d or \u201cbig\u201d or \u201cmuscular.\u201d\nThey led me to believe that I should\nwant the opposite. I should not want\nto inhabit three-dimensional space.\nI should want to be thin and lean\nenough, so I appeared defenseless.\n\nBesides the visible messages that\nthe fitness media was imparting, I\nfound underlying lessons between\nthe aspiration of thigh gaps. They\ntold me that by consuming less\nspace, I would receive more love and\nworth. The areas my body left blank\ncould be filled with more points on\nan attractiveness scale designed by\nmen. As I peered into the images\nof perfectly toned women in\nfitness magazines, I saw their eyes\nhinting to me that a woman\u2019s body\nshould never reveal real power nor\nintimidate men. It was hard to look\naway. Their stare was gripping, and\nsoon I came to see what they saw.\n\nEach day, I followed the sequenc-\nes that were supposed to burn more\ncalories than cardio. I religiously\ndid very little weight at high rep-\netition in order to build leanness\ninstead of big muscles. The fear of\nbecoming unattractive sustained\nmy resistance of looking strong.\nSoon weightlifting became some-\nthing I did for others \u2014 to allow oth-\ners to find me attractive and worthy.\n\nAfter months of revisiting the\nsame routines and the same corners\nof the gym, I still was very removed\nfrom the body I was promised. And\nI was exhausted. I was exhausted by\n\nthe need to constantly adhere to one\nideal and to exercise feebly. I decid-\ned to listen to my exhaustion and to\nabandon what I was supposed to do.\nAs I wished to switch to new rou-\ntines, I found very little knowledge\non how a woman can become strong\ninstead of beautiful.\n\nMy journey to find new ways\nof lifting weights led me to see\nthe obvious.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that so many\nwomen of all ages wish to adhere to\na singular beauty ideal. And it\u2019s no\nwonder most women believe they\nwill become massive bodybuilders if\nthey begin to lift weights. And it\u2019s no\nwonder that the image of a woman\nbodybuilder is unattractive, because\nof its \u201cthreatening\u201d demeanor to\nmen. And it\u2019s no wonder that there\nis little knowledge circulating\nwomen\u2019s minds on how to safely\nand properly lift weights. And it\u2019s\nno wonder that the free weight\nsection of every gym lacks women\nwhile men are overpopulating\n\nit. And it\u2019s no wonder I was\nafraid to ignore norms _ by\nbecoming strong.\n\nAnd it\u2019s no wonder when a\nwoman\u2019s worth is labeled by her\nneed for the strength of men.\n\nAfter learning the hidden\nobviousness, I let my strength truly\nreveal itself. I let my body move\ntoward the gravitational pull it\ndesired. I longed to be strong for\nmyself and honored my body as it\nmorphed into unforeseen molds.\nThrough my journey, I have come to\nappreciate my ability to grow to its\nown tune.\n\n\u2014 Maja Tosic can be reached\nat tosimaj@umich.edu.\n\nEDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS\n\nDevin Eggert, David Harris, Rachel John, Jordyn Kay, Aarica\nMarsh, Megan McDonald, Victoria Noble, Allison Raeck,\nMelissa Scholke, Michael Schramm, Matthew Seligman,\n\nMary Kate Winn, Jenny Wang, Daniel Wang, Derek Wolfe\n\nJAIKOB DJERF AND DANIEL MADION |\n\nA culturally transmitted disease?\n\nOn July 11, the World Health\nOrganization announced its\nrecommendation for all men who\nhave sex with men (MSM) to begin\ntaking antiretroviral drugs as a\nprecaution to combat the spread of\nHIV/AIDS worldwide. This came\nas a shock to many Americans who\nin recent years haven\u2019t read or\nheard many news stories about the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nSince the initial HIV/AIDS\nepidemic started in the 1980s, rates\nof HIV transmission in the United\nStates have generally remained\nstable. According to the Centers for\nDisease Control, it\u2019s estimated that\n1.1 million Americans are living\nwith HIV, and that one out of six\ndon\u2019t know that they have HIV.\n\nThe group in the United States\nthat remains most affected by HIV/\nAIDS is MSM. HIV infection in\nthe United States has declined in\nevery group except gay/bisexual\nmen. Rates of HIV infection have\nactually been increasing among\nthis group. From 2008 to 2010,\nthe rate of new HIV infections for\nMSM climbed 12 percent. In 2010,\nMSM made up approximately 4\npercent of the U.S. population, but\naccounted for 63 percent of all new\nHIV infections.\n\nIn 2010, women accounted for 20\npercent of all new HIV infections,\nand 84 percent of these were\nattributed to heterosexual contact.\nIn that same year, \u201cwhite MSM\ncontinued to account for the largest\nnumber of new HIV infections,\u201d\naccording to the CDC.\n\nTherearetwostigmasat playhere:\nthe assumption in the heterosexual\npopulation that HIV/AIDS is a gay\n\ndisease, and the assumption in the\nwhite MSM population that HIV/\nAIDS is a disease associated with\nminority MSM. The mainstream\nmedia today portrays HIV/AIDS\nin the gay community or in IV\ndrug users. People assume that as\nlong as they aren\u2019t having sex with\npeople from these communities\nthat their risk for HIV isn\u2019t very\nhigh. These stigmas, along with the\nlack of a legitimate sex education,\nthen lead to unsafe sex and not\nbeing regularly tested for sexually\ntransmitted infections. In order to\nstop this unsafe trend, the myths\n\nsurrounding HIV/AIDS must\nbe dispelled.\nOne-fourth of new HIV\n\ninfections occur in youth ages 13\nto 24; most of those infected are\nunknowing, not getting tested/\ntreated and potentially infecting\nmore people. HIV after contraction\nmay or may not produce symptoms.\nWithin two to four weeks after the\ninitial exposure, people may feel\nflu-like symptoms, but eventually\nthese symptoms subside.\n\nMany people will live years\nbefore being diagnosed with HIV\nor AIDS. In a campus survey our\nProgram on Intergroup Relations\nclass group conducted, only 20\npercent of respondents have been\ntested for STIs in the last three\nmonths, and of that 20 percent only\n11 percent were also tested for HIV.\nCommon responses for not being\ntested were that no symptoms are\npresent, or that respondents did\nnot think that they were at risk.\nAnother common response was the\nstigma that goes along with being\ntested for HIV. Respondents didn\u2019t\n\nwant their doctors to think they\nwere gay or having risky sex. This\nis especially true for bisexual men\nwho, because of society, choose not\nto get tested and not to tell partners\nabout their encounters with men.\nThe misconceptions around campus\nabout HIV/AIDS are apparent.\n\nHIV/AIDS affects people indis-\ncriminately, and although the only\nsure way to avoid contracting HIV\nis through abstinence, there are\nmany ways to greatly reduce your\nrisk. These include using latex or\npolyurethane \u2014condoms/barriers,\nusing water-based lubricant, ask-\ning your partner about their sexual\nhistory, avoiding alcohol or drugs as\nthey alter the decision-making and\nchoosing lower-risk sexual activi-\nties. Frequent STI screenings (that\ninclude HIV) are also essential.\nAlthough HIV/AIDS is most promi-\nnent today in the MSM and African\nAmerican community, all sexually\nactive people are at risk. Especially\nwhen involved with casual sex part-\nners who may not have been tested\nthemselves, or may have lied about\ntheir sexual histories. Sleeping with\nsomeone is like sleeping with every-\none that they\u2019ve ever slept with too.\n\nTransmission of HIV is fully\npreventable; most of the new cases\ncontracted are due to a lack of\nknowledge and lack of precaution.\nThere are many great resources in\nAnn Arbor for both STI testing and\nsafe sex. For more information about\nSTI testing and HIV/AIDS statistics,\nplease visit the CDC website or the\nUHS website.\n\nJaikob Djerf is an LSA sophomore\nand Daniel Madion is an LSA freshman.\n\nI am proud to say that after 23 or (24) years on the\nradio we have learned absolutely nothing.

His competitor,\nindependent candidate Bryan\nKelly, garnered 4,728 votes,\napproximately 15.34 percent of\nthe vote.\n\nAlong with Taylor\u2019s assump-\ntion of the mayoral seat, City\nCouncilmembers Sumi Kailas-\napathy (D-Ward 1) and Chuck\nWarpehoski (D-Ward 5) were\nreelected as incumbents, in\naddition to the three coun-\ncilmembers elect Julie Grand\n(D-Ward 1), Graydon Kraphol\n(D-Ward 3) and Kirk Westphal\n(D-Ward 2).\n\n\u201cT am just so excited to have\nbeen elected mayor,\u2019 Taylor\nsaid. \u201cIt is a great honor and\nAnn Arbor is such a wonderful\nplace; I am thrilled and hon-\nored. The city is really going\nin the right track. I think we\nare making progress just tak-\ning care of the basics as well as\nimproving people\u2019s way of life.\nWe've got a lot to do, we\u2019re not\nperfect, but I think these areas\nare going in the right direc-\ntion.\u201d\n\nSince the declaration of his\ncandidacy in December 2013,\nTaylor spent more money than\nany other candidate in this\nhighly contested race. Though\nhis campaign came toascreech-\ning halt in August, he raised a\ntotal of $75,698 in the months\npreceding the primary. Fellow\nCouncilmembers Stephen Kun-\nselman (D-Ward 3), Sabra Bri-\nere (D- Ward 1) and Sally Hart\nPetersen (D-Ward 2) all ran in\nthe Democratic Primary along-\nside Taylor, who carried 47.57\npercent of the vote.\n\nPETERS\nFrom Page 1A\n\nreally got her message across.\u201d\n\nIn remarks to the media\nTuesday night, Peters charac-\nterized his win as the result of\nmonths of traveling the state\nand building out grassroots\nefforts.\n\nAs an independent candi-\ndate, Kelly\u2019s goal in the elec-\ntion was not entirely to win,\nbut rather to spark debate and\nturn an uncontested, one-party\nelection into an opportunity for\nfurther discussion of the issues\nsurrounding the city. Following\nthe announcement of his can-\ndidacy in July, Kelly did little\ncampaigning and focused on\ndeveloping his position on the\nissues themselves through his\nwebsite and various mayoral\ndebates.\n\nTaylor said while his victory\nwas not a surprise, Kelly took\ninitiative and showed a passion\nfor local politics.\n\n\u201cT think that it is a democra-\ncy and people who want to run\ncan and chose to run, and he did\nmake that decision and I hope\nthat it was an experience that\nmet his expectations,\u201d Taylor\nsaid.\n\nTaylor is currently in his\nthird term as a city coun-\ncilmember representing Ward\n3. As the first new mayor in 14\nyears, Taylor has positioned\nhimself to follow in current\nAnn Arbor Mayor John Hieft-\nje\u2019s footsteps.

Chris obviously\nreceived a lot more, and that\nmakes sense, but I\u2019m thrilled\n\n\u201cIT take the job of being a\nrepresentative very seriously,\nwhich means being in the com-\nmunity, being accessible, lis-\ntening to folks, and I think that\npaid off today,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nthey were looking for someone\nwho is out there working to\nearn the right to represent the\npeople of Michigan in Wash-\nington D.C.\u201d\n\nwith this.\u201d\n\nKelly added that he is still\ninterested in city government.\n\n\u201c\u2019'm going to keep an eye\non how the city council Ward\n1 race and see if I agree with\nthe people who are running for\nthat,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Kelly, he said the race\nwas a good experience, gener-\nating thoughtful debate about\nthe issues in Ann Arbor while\nkeeping a lighthearted atmo-\nsphere.

Taylor said he\nexpects to meet with Univer-\nsity President Mark Schlissel\nnext week to discuss issues sur-\nrounding the University\u2019s rela-\ntionship with the city.\n\nFurthermore, Taylor rec-\nognized infrastructure to be\none of the key issues following\nlast winter\u2019s harsh conditions.\nHe said this is in many ways\n\nPeters found success running\non a platform focused on his\nrecord on the economy, climate\nchange and women\u2019s issues.\nEarly in the general election\ncampaign season, he hosted a\n\u201cGreat Lakes Job Tour,\u201d high-\nlighting the role that the state\u2019s\nbusinesses played in support-\ning the Great Lakes and vice\nversa.

There is going to be a\nlearning curve,\u201d Grand said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple meet-\nings with the city attorney, but\nthings like legal details can\u2019t be\nlearned in just a brief orienta-\ntion.\u201d\n\nWestphal said in the next\nfew weeks, communication will\nbe key as he begins his time on\ncity council.\n\n\u201cThere are some clear signs\nthat Ann Arbor is going through\nsome evolution,\u201d Westphal said.\n\u201cT encourage collaboration and\ncoming together to see what\nAnn Arbor will look like in the\nfuture, so to the extent that we\ncan keep everything that is spe-\ncial about Ann Arbor and yet\nwelcome more people here and\nmore opportunity, the better.\u201d\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Jack\nTurman contributed reporting.\n\nCongress, he was also involved\nin legislation to support small\nbusinesses, namely his co-spon-\nsorship of the Small Business\nJobs Act, which gave states\nfunding to create lending pro-\ngrams for small businesses and\nmanufacturers, and he called\nrepeatedly during the campaign\nfor an increase to the minimum\nwage.

However, Univer-\nsity students braved the rain to\ncast their ballots at polling loca-\ntions throughout campus.\n\nAccording to a poll by the\nHarvard Institute of Politics,\nonly 26 percent of young voters\nsaid they would \u201cdefinitely vote\u201d\nprior to the election, similar to\nthe 27-percent proportion in the\n2010 midterm elections.\n\nOf college students, 31 per-\ncent said they would definitely\nvote.\n\nLarry Kestenbaum, Washt-\nenaw County Clerk and Reg-\nister of Deeds, said relatively\nlow voter turnout among young\npeople could be attributed to\ncampaigns and advertising that\nwasn't targeted toward them.\n\nA change in the Michigan\nvoter laws 10 years ago mandat-\ned that first-time voters must\neither vote in person or pick up\n\nSNYDER\nFrom Page 1A\n\nunemployment rate rate is its\nlowest since 2008, though it is\nstill above the national rate of\n5.9 percent.\n\nLast year, Snyder pushed\nthrough Medicaid expansion\nunder the Affordable Care\nAct against the wishes of the\nRepublican-led _ legislature.\nMore than 400,000 people\nhave enrolled in the Healthy\nMichigan Plan since its April\nRepubli-\ncan opposition, Snyder also\n\nlaunch. Despite\nsecured an agreement with\nCanadian officials to go for-\nward with the New Interna-\ntional Trade Crossing, a new\nbridge connecting Detroit and\nWindsor.\n\nfor their families, they want\nto be able to send their kids to\ngood schools and live in safe\n\nan absentee ballot in person.\nKestenbaum said this law was a\nhindrance to students who lived\naway from their home districts,\nand politicians believed that it\nwas futile to attempt to market\nto young voters.\n\nAt Pierpont Commons, Ann\nArbor resident Lisa Jibson, a\npoll volunteer, said many stu-\ndents tried to vote Tuesday who\ncould not. They were registered\nin a district outside of Ann\nArbor or had moved from their\noriginal registration address\nwithin the city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to redirect quite\na few,\u201d Jibson said. \u201cWe hate to\nhave anyone feel like they didn\u2019t\nget the chance to vote.\u201d\n\nLSA freshman Cole Zingas\nvoted for the first time Tuesday\nmorning. Zingas said he wanted\nto vote regardless of party lines,\nand voted for mostly Democrats\nsave Republican Gov. Rick Sny-\nder.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t believe Mark\nSchauer had any kind of real\nplan for the state,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nliked what Rick Snyder did the\nlast few years in Michigan.\u201d\n\nKestenbaum said he antici-\npated larger-than-average par-\nticipation in Washtenaw County\nin this midterm election, to the\ntune of 140,000 voters. The 2010\nmidterm election saw just over\n\nThe Medicaid and bridge\ndecisions were indicative of\nSnyder\u2019s willingness to break\nwith his party, and followed\nthe principles laid out in his\nfirst campaign. A former chief\nexecutive of computer com-\npany Gateway and a venture\ncapitalist, Snyder entered\nthe 2010 gubernatorial race\nas a relative unknown and a\npolitical novice. His pledge to\nput politics aside and instead\nuse his business acumen to\nimprove the state appealed\nto voters, as he sailed to an\n18-point victory over Demo-\ncrat Virg Bernero.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to drop the labels\n... of party, of ideology, of geog-\nraphy,\u201d Snyder said in his 2010\nvictory speech. \u201cTo make this\nwork there is only one label\n\nthat matters. That label is\n\nwant to have quality health care\n\ninently\n\n120,000 turn out to cast a ballot,\nwhile more than 180,000 voted\nin Washtenaw County during\nthe 2012 election.\n\nEarly exit polls from the\nNational Exit Poll data by Edi-\nson Research for this year\u2019s\nmidterm election report that\nthe youth electorate was at 13\npercent, slightly higher than in\n2010, though the statistic is sub-\nject to change within the next\nfew days.\n\nLon Johnson, chair of the\nMichigan Democratic Party,\nsaid voter turnout was a possi-\nble hurdle in the election, yet\nexpressed optimism in the par-\nty\u2019s attempt to get eligible voters\nto the ballots.\n\nPoll\na boost in ballots over 2010.\n\nvolunteers reported\nJibson said turnout was good\nconsidering it was a midterm\nelection.\n\nCollege Republicans, College\nDemocrats and the Public Poli-\ncy School held separate watch\nparties for Tuesday night\u2019s elec-\ntion results.\n\nFour students attended the\nCollege Republicans\u2019 watch\nparty, including LSA senior\nSarah Cunningham. She said\nyounger and older members of\nthe party differ on social issues,\nlike same-sex marriage and\nwomen\u2019s rights, but are bound\n\nMichigander.\u201d\nSnyder echoed \u2014 similar\nsentiments Tuesday night,\n\nexpressing that divisiveness\nand constant blame should\nnot be the political norm. He\nwas instead optimistic that the\nstate could overcome political\nbarriers to work together.\n\n\u201cWe can raise the standard\nof how politics should operate\nin this country,\u201d he said.\n\nYet his smaller margin of\nvictory four years later may\nreflect criticisms that he too\noften broke from his promise\nto avoid promoting partisan\nissues.\n\n\u201cThere were some things\nthat happened in (Snyder)\u2019s\nfirst term that showed he\ncould be quite political, so he\ndidn\u2019t have the same kind of\nindependent persona that he\n\nSupport for President Barack\n\nObama and the auto industry\nbailout also featured prom-\n\ninto the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhat folks want, I found\nwas all common, regardless of\nwhere you are in Michigan,\u201d he\ntold the crowd during his vic-\ntory speech Tuesday evening.\n\u201cPeople want to have a fair\nwage for a fair day\u2019s work. They\n\nneighborhoods. And when it is\nall said and done, people want\nbe able to retire with dignity.\nAnd as Democrats, that is what\nwe have stood for since day one\nand we will continue to stand\nfor days in the future.\u201d\n\nWhile some candidates have\nsought to distance themselves\nfrom Obama and his policies,\none prominent one in Michigan\nbeing the auto bailout, Peters\nhas not. He was the only Senate\ncandidate to have the president\n\nby the principle of conservative\nfiscal policy.\n\nCunningham said being a\nconservative in left-leaning Ann\nArbor is difficult.\n\n\u201cI really wish that I could\nbe much more open about my\npolitical views and I wish that\npeople would be more willing\nto dialogue with me because I\nthink we have so much more in\ncommon with Democrats, espe-\ncially as young Republicans,\nthan most people think we do,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nLSA senior Gabe Leaf, chair\nof the University\u2019s chapter of\nthe College Republicans, said\nhe was chiefly concerned with\nreducing unemployment and\nexpanding Michigan\u2019s economy.\nHis vote for Snyder stemmed\nfrom the governor\u2019s gradual\nincreases in funding higher edu-\ncation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Michigan man him-\nself,\u201d Leaf said. \u201cHe comes from\nus; he knows what we\u2019ve been\nthrough, the kind of struggles\nare for higher education to oper-\nate, and he\u2019s also a businessman\nso he knows how to run these\nthings more effectively.\u201d\n\nLSA junior Stephen Culbert-\nson, communications director\nfor College Democrats, said he\nbelieved the Democratic Party\nhad a better understanding of\n\ndid in the first election, and\nthat cost him the mobilized\nDemocrats,\u201d Political Science\nProf. Mike Traugott said in an\ninterview with The Michigan\nDaily.\n\nIn the legislature\u2019s lame\nduck session in December\n2012, Snyder signed right-to-\nwork legislation into law, out-\nlawing union requirements\nfor members to pay dues as\na condition of employment.\nThe\nSnyder signed a measure ban-\n\nfollowing December,\n\nning abortion coverage from\nprivate health plans, instead\nrequiring women who wanted\nsuch a plan to purchase sup-\nplemental insurance. He has\nalso declined to take a per-\nsonal stance on gay marriage,\nchoosing instead to defer to\nthe pending decision in feder-\n\nhost a rally for him this election\nseason.\n\nIn the night\u2019s other big race,\nDemocrats were less successful;\nincumbent governor Rick Sny-\nder (R) held onto his seat. Peters\nsaid, as state representative, he\nhas already worked with Sny-\nder on building a new bridge\nbetween the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that I think is\n\neducation issues.

We made this race about\nour kids, about seniors, about\nour middle class, about work-\n\nvitally important for the state of\nMichigan, really for the whole\ncountry, to increase trade\nbetween the U.S and Canada\nand I\u2019ve worked with Governor\nSnyder on that, and should he\nbe successful tonight we\u2019ll con-\ntinue to work together,\u201d Peters\ntold the media on working\ntogether with Snyder before the\nrace was called.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the results\nare a bit disappointing, there is a\nlot to look forward to with Gary\nPeters and Debbie Dingell in\nWashington,\u201d he said. \u201dI think\n\ning people.\u201d\n\nHe said he was disappoint-\ned, but not discouraged, by the\nresults.\n\n\u201cThis was not just about\n2014,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a\nmovement about the future of\nour state. IfI learned one thing\nduring this campaign, it\u2019s that\nthe people of Michigan never\ngive up. When we get knocked\ndown, we get right back up.\nFor me, this campaign is over.\nBut for all of us as Democrats,\nas Michiganders who love our\ngreat state, this work must and\nwill continue.\u201d\n\nCollege Republicans Presi-\ndent Gabe Leaf, an LSA senior,\nsaid he has been happy with\nSnyder\u2019s work in higher educa-\ntion, despite public criticism.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really putting a focus\non education,\u201d Leaf said. \u201cHe\u2019s\n\nHe will join U.S Senator Deb-\nbie Stabenow (D-MI), now the\nstate\u2019s senior senator, in Con-\ngress. In replacing Levin, Peters\ntold the media that he would\nseek to continue expressing the\nvalues Levin brought to the job.\n\n\u201cI look forward...to serv-\ning in the Senate, building up\nseniority and doing the hard\nwork necessary for Michigan\n\nthey can represent Michigan\nvery well. They will be tremen-\ndous advocates for Michigan-\nders and the middle class, so\nthat\u2019s a big bright spot tonight.\u201d\n\na Michigan man himself so he\ncomes from us, he knows what\nwe\u2019ve been through, the kind\nof struggles are for higher edu-\ncation to operate and he\u2019s also\na businessman, so he knows\nhow to run these things more\neffectively.\u201d\n\nIn closing his victory speech\nTuesday night, Snyder made a\ncommitment to carry over the\nenergy of reinvention into his\nsecond term.\n\n\u201cThe passion, the fire, the\nexcitement, the conviction to\ndo the reinvention that you\u2019ve\nseen this Tuesday, I\u2019m going to\nhave it on Wednesday, Thurs-\nday, Friday and for the next\nfour years,\u201d Snyder said.\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Shoham\n\nGeva and Emma_ Kinery\n\ncontributed reporting.\n\nand that means being a prac-\ntical, common sense problem\nsolver,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing\nabout Carl Levin, is it\u2019s about\ndoing the job with integrity and\nthoughtfulness. And I look for-\nward to following his footsteps\nand doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Gene-\nvieve Hummer contributed to\nthis report.\n\nRace for regent\ntoo close to call\n\nRepublicans lead\nin early results,\nbut Democrats\nremain hopeful\n\nBy CLAIRE BRYAN and\nALLANA AKHTAR\nDaily Staff Reporters\n\nAs of 2 a.m. Wednesday, the\nrace for two contested spots\non the University\u2019s Board of\nRegents was too close to call.\n\nRepublicans Rob Steele and\nRonald Weiser lead with 596,732\nand 594,196 votes, respective-\nly, compared to Democrats\nMike Behm\u2019s 440,903 votes\nand incumbent Kathy White\u2019s\n477,101 votes.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning,\nthe Michigan Secretary of State\nhad yet to release final tallies\nfrom several counties, including\nthe heavily Democratic Genesee\nand Wayne Counties that con-\ntain Flint and Detroit.\n\nIn 2012, the final election\nresults were not determined\nuntil the following day. In that\nyear, the two Republican can-\ndidates led for most of the early\nmorning hours, but fell to Dem-\nocrats once votes from Wayne\nCounty were tallied.\n\nThe board\u2019s two open seats\nare currently held by Regent\nJulia Darlow (D), who is not\nseeking reelection, and White.\n\nWhite, who currently serves\nas chair of the Board of Regents,\nis a professor of law at Wayne\nState University Law School in\nDetroit, an instructor of law at\nthe United States Military Acad-\nemy at West Point in New York\nand a Lieutenant Colonel in the\nUnited States Army Reserve.\n\nWeiser founded McKinley\nAssociates, a commercial real\nestate company, and served on\nmultiple boards for nonprof-\nit organizations including the\nUnited Negro College Fund of\nWashtenaw County, the Henry\nFord Museum in Dearborn and\nthe Detroit Institute of Arts.\nHe also served as the Amer-\nican ambassador to the Slo-\nvak Republic under the Bush\nAdministration.\n\nSteele, a University Inteflex\nprogram alum, is a cardiologist\nat St. Joseph Mercy Health Sys-\ntem in Ypsilanti and served as\na clinical assistant professor at\nthe University for more than 20\nyears.\n\nBehm works as a litigator in\nFlint and served as president of\nthe Michigan Association for\nJustice in 2011, a trade asso-\nciation. He worked on former\nSecretary of State Hillary Clin-\nton\u2019s presidential campaign and\nserved as a delegate to the Dem-\nocratic National Convention in\n2008.\n\nThe eight-member board is\nelected for eight-year terms on\nthe statewide ballot. The board\nis currently composed of six\nDemocrats and two Republi-\ncans.\n\nIn 2012, Democrats Mark\nBernstein and Shauna Ryder\nDiggs won the two open seats\non the board, carried to victory\nin part by the presidential race\nat the top of the ticket. Similar-\nly, Republicans Andrea Fischer\nNewman and Andrew Richner\nwon the election in 2010, a year\nthat saw low Democratic turn-\nout and the election of Republi-\ncan Goy. Rick Snyder.\n\nIn this election cycle, all four\nmajor-party candidates empha-\nsized affordability in their plat-\n\nforms, but differed on their\nplans for its execution.\n\nSteele had said he planned to\nfinance student loans by tapping\ninto the University\u2019s endow-\nment, while White said she\nintended to strengthen financial\naid. Behm and Weiser see the\nUniversity\u2019s satellite campuses\nin Dearborn and Flint as addi-\ntional, more affordable options\nfor students and said they plan\nto strengthen these campuses.\n\nEarlier this month, the candi-\ndates met for a candidate forum\nat the Gerald R. Ford School of\nPublic Policy to discuss a variety\nof University issues, including\ncampus climate, the institution\u2019s\nresponse to sexual assault and\nworking with the city of Detroit.\n\nMost of the candidates shared\nsimilar views on these issues,\nsuch as going to greater lengths\nto aid survivors of sexual assault\nand working to increase diver-\nsity among students within\nthe boundaries of Proposal 2,\nthe 2006 ballot initiative that\nbanned consideration of race in\ncollege admissions. Behm also\nexpressed support for the Uni-\nversity\u2019s financial divestment\nfrom fossil fuel companies.\n\nIn the last year, the regents\nhave been involved in several\nsignificant decisions, including\nthe appointment of University\nPresident Mark Schlissel.\n\nPolitical Science Prof. Vin-\ncent Hutchings said regent\ncandidates typically don\u2019t gain\nas much publicity compared to\nother races.\n\n\u201cThese lower-level offices put\na bigger burden on the voter,\u201d\nHutchings said. \u201cIt is harder\nfor people to gain information\nabout these people because\ninformation in the media is less\nplentiful.\u201d\n\nCynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-\nvice president\n\nversity\u2019s for\n\ngovernment relations, ran\nunsuccessfully for regent in\n1986.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience, but\nI think what you learn quickly is\nthat the visibility of the regent\nraces is really pretty low in the\nelectorate,\u201d she said.\n\nFor that reason, Wilbanks\nsaid the results in regents races\nare sometimes driven by the top\nof the ticket, particularly when\nvoters cast straight-ticket bal-\nlots.\n\n\u201cStraight party ticket voting\nmay happen a little more fre-\nquently when you are down at\nthe bottom of the ballot,\u201d Wil-\nbanks said. \u201cThat historical pat-\ntern has held true.\u201d\n\nIna telephone interview with\nThe Michigan Daily, Regent\nEmeritus Frederick C. Matthaei\nsaid he does not think parti-\nsanship plays a large role in the\nfunctioning of the board.\n\nMatthaei was appointed\nto the Board in 1967 after the\nresignation of his father, the\nnamesake of the Universi-\nty\u2019s botanical gardens. He ran\nfor reelection a year later as a\nRepublican nominee, but lost\nwhen Democratic presidential\ncandidate Hubert Humphrey\ncarried the state.\n\n\u201cT think their political party\nis important only because they\nhave to run through it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want eight regents to\nbe all on the same party. I think\nit\u2019s good to have a variety of edu-\ncated people, number one, and\nnumber two, it\u2019s a question of\nhow good their personal expe-\nriences could be for serving as a\nregent, not what political party\nthey\u2019re in.\u201d\n",

The original character\ndynamic is simply unparalleled.\nRegardless of Kutcher\u2019s talent,\nSheen still stands as the face of\nthe show, as he has a #winning\nstage presence that simply cannot\nbe matched.\n\nThe premiere starts with\nthe two men and missing half-\nman, donned in their Halloween\n\nbest. Walden unexpectedly\nsuffers a heart attack, and after\nhis \u201cterrifying\u201d near-death\n\nexperience, he completely over-\ndramatizes his dismay to where\nhis \u201cdesperation\u201d seems more like\nsarcasm.\n\nThe premiere continues this\npattern of amalgamating hilarious\nmoments with artificial ones\nto the point where the writing\nsimply feels uncomfortable.\nThere are far too many instances\nwhen Walden\u2019s lines are so over-\ndramatically presented that it is\nambiguous whether he truly is\ntrying to sarcastic or genuine.\n\nEspecially when Walden pokes\nfun at Alan, the jokes seemed\nrehearsed and timed, without\nthe spontaneity that is supposed\nto qualify his character as witty.\nThe humor becomes too cheesy,\nespecially when it is ambiguous \u2014\nat least initially \u2014 whether Walden\nlegitimately has a heart attack or\nwhether he fakes it for attention.\n\nDuring Walden\u2019s contemplation\nof his \u201cpurpose of existence,\u201d he\ndecides he wants to introduce a\nchild in his life, which ironically\ncontradicts his free-spirited\npersona.

Paired\nwith a rough ride through\nthe latest recession, arts\njournalism has found itself\ntaking the blunt of section\n\ncuts and layoffs, frequently\nfalling second to sections\ndeemed more\u2019 important\nand profitable like news\nand sports. However, some\narts-exclusive journalists\n\nhave managed to navigate\nthe changing landscape of\n\njournalism successfully.\nJulie TIovine, architecture\ncolumnist for the Wall Street\nJournal and the former\n\nExecutive Editor for The\nArchitect\u2019s Newspaper, is\na striking example of this\nversatility, and came to the\nUniversity\u2019s Taubman College\nof Architecture and Urban\nPlanning last Wednesday to\ndiscuss the changing worlds\nof both architecture and arts\njournalism.\n\nIn an interview with The\nMichigan Daily, Iovine spoke\nabout her views on students\nbreaking into journalism and\nthe future of architecture.\n\nIovine is a native of\nWashington DC and studied\nAncient Greek at Yale before\ndeciding to become a writer.\nShe developed a love for\narchitecture after living\nin Athens for a year and\nlater moved to New York\nCity to write for various\npublications, including the\nNew York Times, where she\nwas on staff for 13 years\nwriting about architecture\nand design.

They figure\nout what they need to do to\nget through, and that\u2019s what\nwe did. As we look back, it\nwas actually quite a neat\ntime.\u201d\n\nBefore leaving The\nArchitect\u2019s Newspaper,\nIovine helped oversee a large\ndigital expansion, including\nlaunching a sleek website\nas well as Facebook and\nTwitter platforms. Iovine\nnods at critics who question\nhow such a physical art form\ncan translate over a digital\nplatform, yet she believes\nthe advancements have been\npositive for architecture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing and a bad\nthing. It draws even further\narchitecture\u2019s tendency to\nbe a beauty contest, because\nyou can just splash these\n\nspectacular photographs\nonto the internet and that\u2019s\nwhat some people think\n\nit\u2019s all about,\u201d Iovine said.\n\u201cHowever, it also fits itself\nvery smoothly into the world\nof internet visualization.\n\nAs architecture has\nevolved to accommodate\nand embrace an eco-friendly\nlandscape, Iovine highlighted\nthe factors that she takes\ninto consideration during a\ncritique of a new building, the\nfoundation for what she does\nat the Wall Street Journal.\nIn her lecture, she brought\nup examples of exceptional\nworks of architecture, which\nshe believes has changed the\nfuture of the art.\n\n\u201cT need to be able to figure\nout what\u2019s going on, and\nwithout the architect telling\nme. It\u2019s important to me that\nthe building tells me what\u2019s\nimportant, and that the space\nis comprehensible to me just\nas a user, not as someone who\nhas just had the architect\ndescribe it all,\u201d Iovine said.\n\u201cKnowing the constraints\nthat were on the project is\nalso important, whether it\nwas budget, or political or\nzoning issues. People see\nthese things and may judge\nit as horrible, but they don\u2019t\nknow why it\u2019s horrible. It may\nbe that the community had a\n\nstake in it.\u201d\nIovine gave advice to\nTaubman students looking\n\nto break into the competitive\nworld of architecture, from\nthe point of view of someone\nwhose critiques can truly\nchange public opinion\nregarding an artist and their\nbuildings.\n\n\u201cYou have to be absolutely\ndevoted,\u201d Iovine said. \u201cYou\nmust be ready to join the cult\nbefore you take that leap,\nand if you do it can be very\nrewarding.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the ever-\nchanging world of niche\narts journalism, Tovine\nurged national publications\nto retain their arts writers\nand to keep informing and\nshaping public opinion.\n\n\u201c(Arts journalism) will\nthrive, but I worry that it\nwill only thrive among an\ninside track and close in on\nitself,\u201d Iovine said. \u201cThe gap\nwill grow between how the\nwider public understands\nart and art journalists, and\nnewspapers are dropping\ntheir architecture columnists\nleft and right \u2014 There\u2019s only\nsix architecture columnists\nleft in national newspapers.\nThis  shouldn\u2019t be that\nway. More newspapers and\nmagazines should think\nit\u2019s important that there\nbe someone on hand and\ndescribe the world and how\nit\u2019s being shaped.\u201d\n\nTaubman graduate student\nBrooke Dexter and Taubman\nsenior Alyssa Kargl run\nDimensions, the \u2014 student\narchitecture publication at\nU-M. Dimensions releases one\nissue yearly and features the\nwork of dedicated Taubman\nstudents, as well as the\nwork of outside professional\nsources like Iovine.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s\n\nreally important to us is\nshowcasing student work,\nbut also including voices\n\nfrom outside sources that\ninfluence the way students\nthink,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cFor\nexample, hearing (lovine)\nsay that architects need to\nsimplify their words when\ntalking to  non-architects\nis very interesting for us,\nand helps the student work\nstay relevant in the outside\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince (Taubman students)\ncome from the same\narchitecture education,\nsometimes while working we\nbecome somewhat similar\nminded,\u201d Kargl said. \u201cWe\nsometimes get caught in a\ncertain way of thinking or a\ncertain way of learning, so\nlectures like these are always\nrefreshing, and offer a new\nperspective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get too focused\non some small detail of your\nproject that you are so stuck\n\nn,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cWhen you\ncome to lectures like these,\nyou realize that architecture\nis so much bigger than what\nyouw\u2019re working on now, and\nthat\u2019s very refreshing.\u201d\n\n\u201cA degree of architecture\nat Taubman is more like a\ndegree in design,\u201d Kargl said.\n\u201cYou learn speaking skills,\ngraphic design and just a lot\nof things are embedded into\nthe degree.

While\ngoing through his progressions\nbehind center, the fifth-year\nsenior locked in on receiver\nAmara Darboh running a route\nnear the right sideline.\n\nJust as Gardner let go of the\nball, the Hoosiers\u2019 linebacker\nin coverage jumped the route\nand appeared to have the ball in\nhis hands with an easy path to\nthe end zone. Instead, Darboh\nknocked the ball loose and\nprevented the pick six.\n\n\u201cI was kind of thinking ...\nhit the arm cause I hear the\n(defensive backs) coach say that\nall the time. So I just kind of tried\nto swipe and hit the arm and I\u2019m\nthankful he didn\u2019t get the pick,\u201d\nDarboh said after the game.\n\nDarboh has been arguably the\nbest-kept secret of Michigan\u2019s\noffense this season. The receiver\nput that talent on display against\nIndiana, leading the offense with\nnine receptions for 107 yards and\na 12-yard touchdown. It was the\nfirst time the redshirt sophomore\npassed the century mark in his\ncareer.\n\nAll season, Darboh has been\nGardner\u2019s favorite target behind\njunior Devin Funchess. But\nwith Funchess usually receiving\ndouble, sometimes triple,\ncoverage, Gardner has slowly\ngrown a rapport with Darboh,\nwho has 26 catches for 362 yards\nand two touchdowns on the\nseason. Two-hundred-fourteen\nyards of that production have\ncome in the last three games.\n\n\u201cT think, for me, it\u2019s the more\nI play the more I get used to the\ngame,\u201d Darboh said Saturday.\n\u201cAnd feel it out and feel what the\ndefensive backs are doing and feel\nout where to be, and I think the\nmore I play, the more experience\n\nr\n\nI\u2019ve been getting.\u201d\n\nDarboh got his first chance to\nstart when redshirt sophomore\nJehu Chesson was out with an\ninjury against Miami (Ohio)\non Sept. 13.\nIn that game\nDarboh hauled\nin a_ then-\ncareer best six\nreceptions for\n88 yards. And\nwhile Chesson\ngot the start\nwith Funchess\nagainst\nIndiana, it was\nDarboh who\ngot most of the looks.\n\nOn Michigan\u2019s fourth offensive\nplay of the day, Gardner found\nDarboh for a 34-yard completion\n\nB1G blues: Struggles\nare conference-wide\n\nBy ZACH SHAW\nDaily Sports Writer\n\nIt\u2019s no secret the Michigan\nhockey team is struggling.\n\nAfter opening the season\nranked eighth in the nation, the\nWolverines have stumbled to a\n2-5 start, their worst in 28 years.\n\nBut Michigan isn\u2019t the only\nBig Ten team stumbling out of\nthe gate. The Daily gives a team-\nby-team breakdown of what has\ngone wrong (or right) for each\nteam in the opening month.\n\nNo. 1 Minnesota (5-1):\n\nOne month ago, Minnesota\nwas one of three Big Ten teams\nin the top-10. Through six\ngames, the Golden Gophers\nare seventh in the nation with\n3.67 goals per game and have\nconverted 30.4-percent of\npower-play opportunities, good\nfor third in the nation.\n\nThere has been little to\nquestion on the other side of\nthe ice. Minnesota\u2019s eight NHL\ndraftees on defense and junior\ngoaltender Adam _ Wilcox,\nreigning Big Ten player-of-\nthe-year, have ensured that the\nGolden Gophers continue to\nbe the nation\u2019s most complete\nteam. With a seemingly weak\nBig Ten, it\u2019s hard to imagine\nMinnesota doing anything\nshort of running the table in\nconference play.\n\nPenn State (5-1-2):\n\nLast season\u2019s cellar-dwellers\ngenerated plenty of momentum\nwhen it upset Michigan in last\nseason\u2019s Big Ten Tournament.\nThat momentum has continued\nthis season. While much of the\nBig Ten has struggled, Penn\nState has been a surprise starlet\nin its second season as a varsity\nprogram. Scoring three or more\ngoals in all but one game, the\nNittany Lions are third in the\nnation in scoring, and have\nmade sure to treat their fans \u2014\nwhich purchased all available\nseason tickets in three minutes\n\u2014 to entertaining hockey.\n\nOhio State (2-3-1):\n\nAfter splitting and largely\noutplaying No. 12 Providence\nin its opening weekend and\nvaulting into the rankings,\nmany felt Ohio State\u2019s pieces\nhad developed enough to avenge\nlast season\u2019s near-tournament\nmiss.\n\nBut three straight losses\ntempered expectations for the\nBuckeyes, who are now 34th\nin both offense and defense\nand have shown little signs of\nemerging from mediocrity.\n\nMichigan State (2-4):\n\nMichigan State was among\nthe bottom five teams in\nthe country in nearly every\noffensive category last season.\nThis year hasn\u2019t been much\ndifferent. With the exception\nof forward Matt Berry, who\nis seventh in the nation with\nfive goals, the Spartans have\na dismal 13 goals through six\ngames, have already been shut\nout twice, are 2-for-28 on the\npower play and have just five\ngoals in their last four games.\n\nDespite the woes and poor\nstart, Michigan State has\nshown it may not need to score\nthat many goals to win down\nthe road. Led by goaltender\nJake Hildebrand \u2014 among the\nnation\u2019s best netminders \u2014 the\nSpartans are allowing just two\ngoals per game, with the clip\nlowering to 1.25 against ranked\nteams.\n\nWisconsin (0-4):\n\nOf all the Big Ten teams\ngoing through growing pains,\nWisconsin has had it the worst.\nAfter opening the season 10th\nin the country, the Badgers\nhave yet to win a game. With\n13 freshmen, Wisconsin limped\nto two consecutive bye weeks\nhaving scored just three goals,\nfewest in the nation, and going\n0-for-18 on the power play.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a given that\nWisconsin will get better,\nbut with 5-of-6 upcoming\n\ngames against ranked teams,\nimprovement won\u2019t necessarily\ntranslate into wins.\n\n\u201cThe more I\nplay, the more I\nget used to the\n\ngame.\u201d\n\nry\n\non a broken play that required\nimprovisation from the receiver.\nHe had to cut his route short as\nGardner was pressured in the\npocket. Gardner then aired it out\nto give Darboh\ntime to adjust\nand get under\nthe ball. The\ntiming worked\nand  Darboh\nmade the play.\nAfter seeing\nselect time\nduring his\ntrue freshman\nseason, mostly\non special\nteams, Darboh sat out last season\nafter sustaining a preseason foot\ninjury. His return and subsequent\nperformance this season has\n\nkept secret\n\nBi \u201cff __\nq\n\nal f \u201d iz\n\nPAUL SHERMAN/ Daily\nRedshirt sophomore wide receiver Amara Darboh recorded a career-high nine receptions against Indiana for 107 yards.\n\nbeen a welcome surprise for the\nWolverines. It has been a season\nof firsts for the Des Moines\nnative, beginning with his first\ncareer reception \u2014 a 26-yarder\nagainst Appalachian State in\nweek one.\n\n\u201cDarboh) works extremely\nhard and it\u2019s nice to see those\nkinds of kids when they are\nrewarded because of the hard\nwork,\u201d Hoke said Saturday.\n\u201cAmara, you know we have Devin\non one side and Amara on the\nother, it maybe opens up some\nthings a little better.\u201d\n\nIf Funchess decides to forego\nhis last season of eligibility for the\nNFL Draft, it could be Darboh\u2019s\nshow next year. And after the last\nfew games it appears he is more\nthan up to the challenge.\n\nNovember 5, 2014 \u2014 7A\n\nChatman stepping\ninto starter\u2019s role\n\nBy JAKE LOURIM\nDaily Sports Editor\n\nYes, Michigan freshman\nKameron Chatman plays a very\nsimilar style to former Wolverine\nGlenn Robinson III. Yes, he plays\nthe same position as Robinson\ndid. And yes, Robinson left that\nspot open when he declared for\nthe NBA Draft last spring.\n\nBut no, Chatman is not looking\nto replace Robinson.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't really compare\nmyself to him,\u201d he said Thursday\nat the team\u2019s media day. \u201cHe was\na great player, but I don\u2019t really\ngo out there and try to compare\nmyself to him.\u201d\n\nWhether he likes it or not,\nChatman will be counted on at\nleast sometimes this season to fill\nthe void Robinson left.\n\nChatman feels good about\nhis basketball IQ as he prepares\nto play meaningful minutes\nin his first season. Michigan\ncoach John Beilein\u2019s success at\nturning freshman role players\ninto sophomore stars has been\nwell-documented, but Chatman\nthinks he\u2019s ready to step in right\naway.\n\nBeilein is still undecided on\na possible starting lineup, but\nChatman has the potential to fill\nthat void. Chatman is 6-foot-7,\n210 pounds, Robinson 6-foot-6,\n220. Chatman was the No. 38\noverall recruit in the 2014 class\nand was listed as asmall forward,\nbut projects to be a stretch-four,\nmuch like Robinson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to play both\nforward positions as well, and if\nwe ever got stuck, he could play\nin the backcourt,\u201d Beilein said\nOct. 2 before the team opened\npractice. \u201cAll of the freshmen are\nOK. What happens when we put\ntwo or three weeks together?\u201d\n\nThe Wolverines have now\n\nput four weeks together, and\nThursday at open practice,\nChatman looked the part of a\nstarter. He showed his length\nand athleticism on both sides,\nmuch like Robinson did. He was\nknocked around abit during mock\ncontact drills, but he is already\nlisted at 10 pounds heavier than\nhe is in his recruiting profile.\n\nAnd despite the possible\ndifference in physicality, he is\nan inch taller with a wingspan\nsimilar to Robinson\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe saw early that he could be\narotation guy,\u201d Beilein said. \u201cWe\nhave a rating system that we use\nthat I won\u2019t share with you, but\nthere\u2019s a number we give a guy\nwho we feel is in the rotation of\ntop eight as a freshman, and he\ngraded out at that.\u201d\n\nThe coach said being in the\ntop five and being ready to start\nis very different, another step\nup from his current spot in the\ntop-eight rotation. But with\nsophomore Derrick Walton\nJr., junior Caris LeVert and\nsophomore Zak Irvin appearing\nas clear starters, Chatman looks\nto be one of the viable candidates\nfor the fourth spot, beside a host\nof big men at the \u20185.\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t\nslide to the \u20182\u2019 or \u20183\u2019 to fill in.\n\n\u201cWe have guards, we have\nforwards and we have a guy that\nplays in the middle,\u201d Beilein said\nOct. 2. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll have\nfour of them out there at one time\nthat are guards. Because of Kam\u2019s\nball handling ability, I think he\ncan play a lot of positions.\u201d\n\nFor now, Chatman\u2019s skill puts\nhim in a good spot for playing\ntime starting with Monday\u2019s\nexhibition against | Wayne\nState. He'll likely be playing in\nRobinson\u2019s old spot, and he\u2019ll be\ncompared to him, whether he\nlikes it or not.\n\n\u201cThe best coaching staff in America\u2019\n\nBy MINH DOAN\nDaily Sports Writer\n\nThe Michigan women\u2019s\nbasketball coaching staff spends\nso much time together that\nsometimes, coach Kim Barnes\nArico jokes they need mandatory\ntime away from each other.\n\n\u201cSometimes we need to say,\n\u2018T\u2019m not allowed to see you,\u2019\nbecause I could show up at\nchurch and there\u2019s (assistant)\ncoach (Melanie) Moore with\nher family as well,\u201d Barnes\nArico said.\n\nBut it\u2019s that family-type\natmosphere Barnes Arico has\ntried to cultivate that has created\nsuccess within the program.\n\nWith players coming and\ngoing every year, the variable\nthat has remained constant is\nthe coaching staff.\n\nThat\u2019s why Michigan was able\nto get back to the postseason\nafter losing its core after Barnes\nArico\u2019s first year.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why this group\nof coaches is as Barnes Arico\nsaid, \u201cThe best coaching staff in\nAmerica.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s family here,\u201d Moore\nsaid. \u201cI have two little ones\nat home, and they\u2019re around\nthe staff because they\u2019re great\npeople. They\u2019re all here for one\ngoal, which is to put Michigan\nwomen\u2019s basketball on the map.\nWe have each other\u2019s back, and\nit\u2019s a great atmosphere.\u201d\n\nOff the basketball court, the\nstaff spends time together with\nactivities such as watching\nfootball games together and\nSunday dinners at Barnes Arico\u2019s\nhouse.\n\n\u201cWe're with these guys more\nthan we are with our own\nfamilies,\u201d Moore said. \u201c(Barnes\nArico) does an excellent job of\nmaking sure we have excellent\nchemistry on our staff.\u201d\n\nThe dynamic is a cohesive\none, too. Michigan boasts a\ncoaching staff that is comprised\nof only women, with Moore and\nBarnes Arico being mothers.\n\n\u201cT think one of the greatest\nthings about having an_all-\nwoman staff is that you really\nunderstand the players,\u201d Barnes\n\nArico said. \u201cAnd with some of us\nbeing moms, we understand how\nthe kids in our program need to\nbe treated as someone\u2019s child, as\nwell as how they can be pushed\nand challenged.\u201d\n\nBeyond chemistry and\ncohesion, two of the three\nassistant coaches already had\nexperience coaching with\nBarnes Arico at St. John\u2019s, with\nassistant coach Joy McCorvey\neven playing for her.\n\nMcCorvey came to Ann\nArbor with Barnes Arico from\nSt. John\u2019s, where she was\npart of the staff that broke\nConnecticut\u2019s 99-game home\nwinning streak in 2012.\n\nShe played under Barnes\nArico from 2006-2010 with the\nRed Storm, where she was a\ncaptain and ranked third all-\ntime in St. John\u2019s history with\n\n777 career rebounds.\n\u201cT think one of the greatest\nattributes Joy has is she\n\nunderstands me better than\nanyone else,\u201d Barnes Arico\nsaid. \u201cShe really knows the\nexpectations and the demands\nT have.\u201d\n\nMcCorvey, who coaches the\npost players, was instrumental\nin senior forward Cyesha\n\nGoree\u2019s success last season.\n\nWhile she is known to be\ntougher on the players, with just\nfour years since McCorvey was\nin college, she has also become\nsomething ofa big sister to many\nof the players, including Goree.\n\nAssistant coach Megan Duffy\nis in her first season at Michigan\nafter making the move from\nGeorge Washington, where she\nwas also an assistant. Before\nshe coached the Colonials,\nthough, she coached at St. John\u2019s\nwith Barnes Arico, and when a\nposition opened up at Michigan,\nit was a seamless fit.\n\n\u201cWhen we had an opening, I\ncalled Coach Duffy, as kind of\nset up, and asked her \u2018Would you\nrecommend anyone?\u2019 without\nmentioning her,\u201d Barnes Arico\nsaid. \u201cA couple days later,\n(Duffy) called me back and said,\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t you mention me?\u2019...\nand the rest is history.\u201d\n\nFive years removed from\nthe WNBA, Duffy still has the\nsame competitive drive that got\nher drafted 31st overall by the\n\nMinnesota Lynx.\n\u201cCoach Duffy\u2019s a bit of a\nperfectionist,\u201d Barnes Arico\n\nsaid. \u201cShe checks in with (the\nplayers) constantly, to make sure\n\nour point guards are the best in\nthe country.\u201d\n\nMoore is the only coach on\nstaff who didn\u2019t know Barnes\nArico personally before coming\nto Michigan, but the first time\nBarnes Arico talked to her, she\nknew Moore would be a good fit\non her staff.\n\nComing from _ Princeton,\nMoore understands the time\ncommitments of being a student-\nathlete at an academics-heavy\nuniversity. This has made her\ntransition from the Ivy League\nto the Big Ten easy.\n\nMoore, who coaches the\nguards, is known for her\nenergetic and positive coaching\nstyle.\n\n\u201cCoach Moore is super\npositive, she\u2019s \u2018P-squared in\nA-squared, Positive Patty in Ann\nArbor,\u201d Barnes Arico said. \u201cShe\u2019s\nenergetic, she\u2019s encouraging,\nand the kids love to be around\nher.\u201d\n\nWith such a_ turnaround\nfrom Barnes Arico\u2019s first and\nsecond years, when she lost a\nfull starting lineup, the program\ncontinues to make a name for\nitself in the NCAA.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all due to \u201cthe best\ncoaching staff in America.\u201d\n\nLUNA ANNA ARCHEY/Daily\nMichigan women's basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico has helped assemble a familiar staff to help her teams succeed.\n",

To make heads turn wherever you go, build a brand for yourself\n\nand make yourself known.\n\nCreating a unified image for yourself is the key to defining your\npersonality. Whether it comes across in the way you talk, dress\nor work, make sure your choices are consistent.\n\nWhen it comes to opportunities to be in the spotlight, look for\nyour chance to be featured in the media. Try to speak about your\nexperiences whenever you can.\n\nWho are you as a leader, and what are your stance on issues?\nBeing well-spoken and well-informed can help your build you\nbrand.\n\nGo out and meet new people. Build on the relationships you\nalready have so you can create a stronger network for yourself.\n\nWe all have strengths and weaknesses, but finding a group\nof people that complement your skills and are willing to help\nyou work on your weaknesses will strengthen how you define\nyourself.\n\nTHE WEEKLY REEL\nTHE TOXIC TOUR\n\nAs TRS a if\nee PRS Fh\n\npaar nh me\n\n~~ \u2014 I\n\nWATCH MORE AT MICHIGANDAILY.COM\n\n\u2014 THE Statement\n\nMagazine Editor: Photo Editor: Managing Editor:\nCarlina Duan Ruby Wallau Katie Burke\nDeputy Editors: Illustrator: Copy Editors:\nMax Radwin Megan Mulholland Mark Ossolinski\nAmrutha Sivakumar \u2014 Editor in Chief: Meaghan Thompson\nDesign Editor: Peter Shahin\nAmy Mackens\n\nCOVER BY RUBY WALLAU\n\nfrom the pews: the evolution of my Methodism\n\nBY CLAIRE BRYAN\n\noming to college, I shoved\n\nmy religion forcibly to the\n\nback of my brain. For once\nI didn\u2019t have to look for the twinge\nin my father\u2019s eye as I declined his\ngrey slacks, button down and trips\nto church with our grandmoth-\ner, and in turn ate his eggs on an\norange ceramic plate, balancing on\nmy bare knees, curled up in the cor-\nner of the couch.\n\nI watch many of my friends pack\nup their backpacks at 9 p.m. on\nSunday nights to leave the library\nand walk to church service. Every\nweek, parentless, rule-free college\nstudents prioritize their faith over\ntheir studies, over their sleep, over\nan extra hour of late night conver-\nsation with friends.\n\nBut this summer, noise around\nhomosexuality in the United\nMethodist Church compelled me\nto return to 10 o\u2019clock service on\na 90-degree morning, to join indi-\nviduals who believed our church\u2019s\nmission statement should change,\nand propelled me to examine the\nfinite meaning of how I stand as a\nMethodist.\n\nThe United Methodist Church\ntoday is at a crossroads. Among\nall participants, from individuals\nsitting in the pews, to pastors of\nchurches, to clergy of the Office\nof the Bishop, the discipline is\nbeing scrutinized and changes are\nmanifesting in some of the largest,\n\nmost tangible ways. The advocacy\ngroup, Reconciling Ministries\nNetwork, is mobilizing United\nMethodist Churches across the\ncountry to rewrite their mission\nstatements and be open and affirm-\ning of all LGBTQ persons.\n\nReverend Frank Schaefer, a\n\nJesus on Hamosexvali ry\n\nUnited Method-\nist minister, lost his\nordination creden-\ntials after marrying\nhis own gay son to\nanother man. After\nthree phases of his\ntrial in front of the\n\nUnited Methodist\nChurch\u2019s Judicial\nCouncil, Schaefer\n\nwas defrocked for\nviolating his pasto-\nral vows. Six months\nlater an appeals\npanel of church offi-\ncials overturned that\ndecision and wel-\ncomed him back into\nhis role. This is one\ncase among hundreds\nthat lacks fluid consen-\nsus. Some bishops punish\nclergymen and women who have\nopenly performed gay marriages\nwith preventing them to work for a\nday or a week. Other bishops revoke\ntheir credentials entirely, shaming\nthem and stripping them of the job\nthey passionately believe in. The\ndifferences in their approach to the\nissue are immense and incoherent.\n\nMy church\u2019s motto, \u201cOpen\nMinds, Open Hearts, Open Doors,\u201d\nwhich had been engrained in every\npamphlet, Sunday school activity\nand sermon growing up, did not\nhold true. In Ann Arbor, I found\nthat the Wesley Foundation, a\nUniversity of Michigan campus\nministry of the United Methodist\nChurch, was worlds ahead of my\nchurch back home. One evening,\nI questioned Reverend Rob Roth,\nthe current chaplain of the Wesley\nFoundation, about how his church\ntransformed into a rec-\nonciling one \u2014 and as I\ndid my own resistance\nto Methodism morphed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t come from\nthe facts that stood\nclear in my mind con-\nfsistently. There are\nseven major passages in\nthe Bible condemning\nhomosexuality in some\n_A\u2018orm \u2014 none of them\n\nare Jesus speaking, and\n\nmore importantly, none\n\nof them speak to how\n\nwe understand homo-\n\nsexuality or bisexuality\n\n\\ eet\n\n7\n!\n\nILLUSTRATIONS BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND\n\nin 2014. Modern psychology hasn\u2019t\nrecognized homosexuality as men-\ntal illness for decades and Method-\nism respects the science of its time.\nMethodism stays consistent to its\ninterpretations. If we take Leviti-\ncus 18:22, \u201cthou shalt not lie with\nmankind, as with womankind: it is\nabomination,\u201d that would mean we\nwould need to take every passage,\nevery sin and punishment, literally.\n\nBut where my identity evolved\nwas where I learned that being\nMethodist did not mean stand-\ning with a list of beliefs every one\nof my fellow Methodists believed.\nIssues of homosexuality would not\nbe on that list, because Methodism,\nunlike so many religions, does not\nhave a list. We have articles of faith\nin our discipline that we respect but\nwe are not a confessional church.\nInstead, we have a quadrilateral\nscripture that embodies: scripture,\ntradition, reason and experience.\nMethodists, by definition, means\nthe person sitting next to you in\nthe pew takes scripture, tradition,\nreason and experience in any form\nthey believe. We are not taught or\ndirected, we are enlightened and\ngiven the opportunity to interpret.\nAnd today, not enough have inter-\npreted and understood that those\nseven passages should not keep\ngays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgen-\nder or any other humans out of the\nchurch. We must continue to inter-\npret so others can continue to stand\nas Methodists.\n",

I\nthink that\u2019s what led the AD to realize that it was time for him to step away for the good\n\nof the athletic program and the University as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u2014University president MARK SCHLISSEL on Athletic Director Dave Brandon\u2019s resignation\n\nTHE THOUGHT BUBBLE\n\nRUBY WALLAU/Daily\n\nunderwear I\u2019m supposed to\nbuy anymore.\n\nWhen I was a toddler, briefs\n\nwere the thing. Then boxer briefs\nwhen I grew up alittle. Boxers were\ncool because you were supposed to\nsag your pants and show them off.\nI guess it was considered \u201ccool\u201d at\nthe time. I mean I still think box-\ners are cool \u2014 cool enough, or I\nwouldn\u2019t wear them. I don\u2019t sag\nmy pants like a little hoodlum any-\nmore, though.\nA My boxers have neat patterns on\nthem, usually. Most of them have\na checkered pattern of some kind.\nBut the nice ones have vertical\nstripes. I can\u2019t explain it, but there\u2019s\nsomething classy about vertical\nstripes. Once my brother asked for\nsilk underwear for Christmas, and\nthey had vertical stripes, too. You\ncan\u2019t get silk underwear in check-\nered pattern, that\u2019s for damn sure.\n\n[\u00ab not sure what kind of\n\nweb As A\n\nI study water quality, water purification, sustainability of using water ... Water is a huge\nissue. We don\u2019t consider the fact that there could be a drought and you might turn on\nyour tap and water won\u2019t come out of it ... You have to have water to do things.

Should I\nalso be wearing them? Not that I\u2019m\nfeeling undergarment-related peer\npressure, but I\u2019m just wondering\nif there\u2019s a benefit to boxer briefs.\nWhy the switch, guys? They look\ntoo tight, too revealing, too uncom-\nfortable. At the same time, they\nseem like a more mature type of\nunderwear. It seems like the kind of\nunderwear that a twenty- or thirty-\nsomething would wear. In fact, \u2019m\npretty sure that\u2019s the kind of under-\nwear that my dad wears, and he\u2019s\nfifty-something. The other day I\nwas considering making the change\nto demonstrate an increased level\nof maturity. A fake it till you make it\nkind of thing. But at the same time,\nT\u2019m content with boxers.
